5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter One|The Pandavas Prepare for War|False|"After Abhimanyu's marriage, there was royal festival and everyone was pleased that the son of Arjuna was united with the daughter of King Virata. The next  all the Kings, who had assembled for Yudhisthira's cause, came to Virata's imperial court to discuss future plans. The assembly consisted of King Virata, King Drupada, Satyaki, King Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. Also present were Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His very powerful brother, Balarama. From the Yadu house came Pradyumna and Samba. Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu was present, as well as the sons of Draupadi, appearing like their fathers in prowess. Drupada's sons and Virata's sons were also seated in the court. They all talked on varied subjects for some time, and after conversing with each other, they sat in a thoughtful mood, their eyes fixed on the beautiful form of Lord Krishna. The Lord sat in the midst of the assembled kings like the full moon amidst the many stars in the sky. With His lotus like eyes and bluish complexion, He was attracting the minds of everyone. While gazing upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead with insatiable glances, they waited for Him to speak. After due contemplation, the Lord of the universe spoke, It is known to all that the Pandavas were unfairly defeated in gambling by Suvala's son, and thus swindled out of their kingdom. They were then exiled to the forest for the thirteen year period, which they faithfully carried out. Dhritarastra's sons still maintain their illicit desires for complete sovereignty of the world, although the sons of Pandu also have a right to share half that kingdom. What Duryodhana exactly thinks is not completely known, so what opinion can be formed? Therefore, a competent person should be selected who can go to Hastinapura and induce the Kauravas to give half the kingdom to the Pandavas.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter One|The Pandavas Prepare for War|False|"After listening to the words of His younger brother, Lord Baladeva, the carrier of the club and plow, spoke to the assembled Kings, You have heard the advice of Krishna which is pregnant with virtue and beneficial to both Yudhisthira and Duryodhana. Dhritarastra's sons should give half their kingdom joyfully so this quarrel can be settled. It is known that when Yudhisthira was in possession of the throne, he unnecessarily engaged in gambling, although he was not able to play the game well. He foolishly gambled away his kingdom, and no blame can be put on Shakuni. Therefore, the messenger should approach the sons of Dhritarastra with words of humility intended to pacify Duryodhana. Nothing can be gained by war with the Kurus.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter One|The Pandavas Prepare for War|False|"After Lord Balarama finished expressing His opinion, the scion of Shini's dynasty, Satyaki, rose up and condemned Lord Balarama's words which favored Duryodhana. Satyaki proclaimed, A man will certainly speak what is in his heart. It is well known that You cherish affection for Duryodhana although he is unprincipled. By his deceitful nature, he tricked the sons of Pandu out of their kingdom. Instead of facing them on the battlefield, they chose to cheat them out of their kingdom by throwing dice. They are cowards of the highest order. Why should Yudhisthira, who is entitled to the ancestral throne, humble himself before the uncivilized Duryodhana, who tried to see the Pandava's beloved wife stripped naked in the imperial court. They should either give back the kingdom or be ready to fight. Who can withstand Arjuna on the battlefield? Who can stand in front of Lord Krishna as He wields His Sudarshana discus to destroy the entire array of the Kurus? Who can withstand the tenacious Bhima, mace in hand, ready to destroy the ranks of the oncoming enemy? There is no need to approach them like beggars. Either Yudhisthira is given back his kingdom this very , or Dhritarastra's sons will lie on the earth slain by me!

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter One|The Pandavas Prepare for War|False|"After Satyaki's speech, the eminent king Drupada gave his opinion, You have spoken well. Never will Duryodhana agree to give up his kingdom by peaceful means. Dhritarastra will agree with his son's wishes, and Bhishma and Drona will follow out of stupidity. Karna and Shakuni will certainly join forces with Duryodhana out of folly. The words of Baladeva are, indeed, righteous, but Duryodhana should never be addressed in mild words. Sweet words are never spoken to a snake, but a weapon must be used to kill it. An envoy should be sent to Duryodhana demanding half the kingdom. At the same time a message should be sent to all kings of the earth who favor Yudhisthira's cause. Let them come here to support us.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter One|The Pandavas Prepare for War|False|"Lord Krishna then gave the final opinion, King Drupada's words are well spoken and meant to promote the interests of Pandu's sons. However, our relationship to both the Kurus and the Pandavas is equal. We have been invited here for the marriage ceremony of Abhimanyu. The marriage ceremony is now complete, and we should return to our kingdoms. Since you, King Drupada, are the eldest and most respected amongst us, you should send a message to Duryodhana, requesting half the kingdom. If Dhritarastra's son should make peace, then there should be no hard feelings on either side. However, if Duryodhana refuses to make peace, then after calling others for war, also call upon us. The wicked will have to face the onslaught of the Gandiva bow as well as My wrath.  Saying this much, Lord Krishna made preparations to leave the Matsya capital. He was worshiped by King Virata as well as by all the kings present. After the departure of Lord Krishna, the Supreme Lord of heaven and earth, King Yudhisthira, along with King Virata, began making preparations for war. King Drupada sent for one of his most trusted priests and gave him a message to be spoken in the midst of the Kaurava leaders. The priest then departed.

The third son of Kunti, Arjuna, then left for Dvaraka in hopes of obtaining the favor of both Lord Krishna and Lord Baladeva. When Duryodhana learned through spies of the Pandava's intentions, he also set out for Dvaraka, accompanied by a small number of troops. Both Arjuna and Dhritarastra's son arrived in the city of the Yadus on the same . At the time they arrived, Lord Krishna was sleeping, and they both entered His room together. Duryodhana sat at the head of the bed whereas Arjuna sat at Lord Krishna's lotus feet. When Lord Krishna awoke, He saw Arjuna first, seated at the end of the bed. He greeted both Arjuna and Duryodhana and asked about their welfare. Duryodhana then solicited Lord Krishna, I am requesting Your support for a future war. Arjuna and myself are equally Your friends. O descendent of Madhu, You bear the same relationship to both families. Therefore, since I have come to You first, please follow the path of virtuous men. You are listed at the top of all who are righteous, and therefore I ask You assist me at this time.

I have a body of soldiers known as the Narayanas, numbering one million men; that is one choice. The other choice is Myself. However, I will not fight in the battle. Arjuna, you may choose between Myself and My Own men. Since you are the youngest, you may pick first.

Joyfully, Duryodhana chose Lord Krishna's division of troops, shunning the personal power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After this meeting, Duryodhana went to Lord Balarama, the possessor of infinite power. Duryodhana explained how Krishna was chosen by Arjuna, although He Himself would not fight. Duryodhana then requested Lord Balarama to fight for his cause. Hearing this appeal, Balarama replied to Duryodhana, When we were present at Abhimanyu's marriage ceremony, I spoke in your favor. I supported affection for both parties, although Krishna did not agree. Krishna has now chosen Arjuna's side, and under no circumstances can I fight against Him. Therefore, I will fight neither for the sons of Pandu nor the sons of Dhritarastra.

So large was that division of troops that when it was encamped, it covered twelve miles. When Duryodhana learned of Salya's intentions, he ordered the best accommodations be made for his comfort. Different houses were erected along his route, and when Salya was entertained in those houses, he became joyful at the thought that Yudhisthira had gone to so much trouble for his comfort. He was given the most royal treatment, on an equal level with the demigods. Still thinking that it was Yudhisthira who had made the arrangements, he called for those men who had supervised the accommodations. He vowed that he would grant a benediction to whoever made such nice arrangements. When Duryodhana came before Salya, and Salya understood that it was Duryodhana who had made all the arrangements, Salya said, You may take a benediction from me.

Also coming to the side of the Pandavas was the stalwart Chedi king, Dhristaketu, accompanied by an akshauhini division of soldiers.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter One|The Pandavas Prepare for War|True|"There is certainly a difference between a devotee of the Lord like Arjuna, and a materialistic person like Duryodhana. The materialist always thinks in terms of profit, and a devotee always wants to please Lord Krishna. Duryodhana had come to Krishna, not to please him, but for material benefit. Lord Krishna gave Arjuna the first choice: men or Himself. Arjuna did not think in material terms. He just want to serve Krishna and get Lord Krishna's constant association. He knew that was the perfect formula for success. Duryodhana was very happy to get an akshauhini division of soldiers, thinking that if he outnumbered Yudhisthira, he would be the victor. Materialists never take into consideration the mercy of the Lord. Arjuna was perfectly happy to have Lord Krishna's association for he knew that wherever there was Krishna, there would certainly be victory.

He tricked Salya into taking his side during the battle of Kurukshetra. It really didn't make any difference if Duryodhana had an unlimited number of akshauhini divisions, for it was the Lord's desire that Duryodhana be punished for his sinful activities. Whoever Krishna wants to kill, no one can protect, and whoever Krishna wants to save, no one can kill. Because Duryodhana was lacking any farthing of pious activity, he could never catch up this point.

He spoke in the presence of Bhishma, Drona, Dhritarastra, Duryodhana, Karna, Vidura and others. It is well known that Dhritarastra and Pandu were born of the same father. There is no doubt that they should equally share the wealth of the father. Why now are Pandu's sons not given an equal portion of that wealth? Dhritarastra's sons have tried in the past to exterminate the Pandavas from the face of the earth, but have not been successful. Even after the sons of Pandu acquired a kingdom by their own endeavors, the scheming Duryodhana cheated them out of it with the aid of Suvala's son, Shakuni. Their beautiful wife was also insulted by Duhshasana, and they were then sent to the forest for thirteen years. This was all with the consent of Dhritarastra. Those pious sons of Pandu have now emerged from exile and want a peaceful settlement with the Kurus. Despite all the offenses that have been committed in the past, they are willing to forget them, and are not eager for war with Dhritarastra's sons. They desire to get back their own kingdom with out involving the world in ruin. The sons of Pandu are now more powerful. Although the Pandavas have only seven akshauhini divisions of soldiers, while the Kurus have eleven, these are counteracted by men who equal a thousand akshauhini division of troops, such as Bhima and Satyaki. There is also the mighty-armed Dhananjaya who has the strength alone to defeat these forces. For his chariot driver, Arjuna now has Vasudeva's son, Krishna, who possesses infinite wisdom. Who is there in the world who will oppose them? Therefore, give back to the Pandavas what is rightly theirs and avoid any unnecessary bloodshed.

One who seeks after wealth in this world suffers from material attraction, but one who acquires virtue and truthfulness never laments, for these treasures no one can take from him. Therefore, desist from the desire for kingdom and wealth so that humanity can be saved from a dreaded war. When you went to the forest for exile, all the kings of the earth came to your aid. You could have at that time humbled the pride of the puffed-up Duryodhana. Why have you allowed your enemies to grow so powerful?

Yudhisthira is ever mindful of his duties, and has never even known lust or wickedness in his heart. The kshatriya's duty is to protect those around him. If a kshatriya unlawfully takes the property of another, then he is subject to be punished. Duryodhana has unlawfully taken the Pandava's kingdom, and therefore he deserves to be punished.

Therefore, wherever there is Krishna, then there must certainly be victory. Through Arjuna, Lord Krishna will kill your wicked sons who are addicted to sin. It is by the will of the Supreme Lord Krishna that the wheel of time revolves causing the destruction of all creatures. I tell you truly He is the Lord of time, of death, of this universe, and of movable and immovable objects.

Keshava, however, is immeasurable and is above the power of speech to describe. He is called Vasudeva in consequence of his covering all creatures with the curtain of illusion, or of His glorious splendor, or of His being the support of the mighty creation. He is called Vishnu because of his all pervading nature. He is called Madhava because He is the husband of the goddess of fortune. O Bharata, He is called Madhusudana, because he once killed the powerful demon Madhu. He was born in the Satvata race and given the name Krishna. The word krish is the attractive feature of the Lord's existence, and na, means pleasure. When the verb krish is added to the affix na, it becomes Krishna, which indicates the Absolute Truth or the reservoir of all pleasure. He is called Pundarikaksha, meaning one who has lotus-like eyes. He is called Janardana, because he strikes fear into the heart of all atheistic persons. He is also known as Vrishabhakshana. Vrishabha means the Vedas and ikshana means the eye. The union of the two means through the eyes of the scripture He can be seen. The conqueror of hosts is called Aja which means that He is unborn. Krishna is like the sun. The sun appears to take birth on the horizon, but it always exists. Similarly, Krishna appears to take birth from the womb of Devaki, but in actuality He eternally exists. That Supreme Soul is known as Damodara, meaning one who was bound around the waist by His foster mother Yashoda. He is called Hrishikesha because He is the Lord of the senses, and only by His grace can the fleeting senses be controlled. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called Mahavahu, because He holds up the Earth and the sky with His two arms. He is also known as Adhoksaja because He never falls down of suffers deterioration. He is called Narayana because He is the resting place of all living beings. That Supreme Lord is called Purushottama because he is the foremost of all living beings. He possesses knowledge of all things, and is therefore known as Sarva. Truth always resides in Krishna, and He is therefore known as Satya. He is called Ananta because He holds all the planets in their proper orbits. Krishna is the Divine Lord of all beings, and it is He who will come here tomorrow to prevent the slaughter of the Kurus.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter Two|Discussions of Peace Between the Pandavas and the Kauravas|True|"The Pandavas, obviously, were not interested in war. Yudhisthira requested his kingdom of Indraprastha, and he was willing to overlook all offenses. However, Duryodhana was not interested in peace. Even after he heard the glories of Lord Krishna, he was not willing for peace. He was a determined demon and headed for certain death. This shows that personal association with the Lord is not everything. Many demons had the association of Lord Krishna, but could not surrender to the will of the Lord. Personal association with the Lord is not as important as a pure heart. Those with pure hearts can see the Lord within, and thus they have the constant association of the Lord. This is confirmed in the Brahma Samhita, premanjana cchurita-bhakti-vilochanena, santah sadaiva hrieshu viokayanti, yam shyamasundarm achintya-guna-svarupam, govindam adi purusham tam aham bhajami, I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Shyamasundar, Krishna Himself, with inconceivable, innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotee see with heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.

Men, women and children are talking about it, and all are speaking respectfully. The citizens are congregating together and discussing it in the open market places. All are saying that Lord Krishna, the slayer of Madhu, is coming to Hastinapura. He is the Lord of all creatures, and on Him rests the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe. Indeed, intelligence, prowess, wisdom and energy all reside in this best among men. If He is worshiped, he is sure to bestow happiness, and if He is not worshiped, He is sure to be the cause of our suffering. If He is pleased with us, then all our plans will fructify. Let us immediately make arrangements for His reception. Pavilions should be set up along the road, furnished with every object of enjoyment. O Duryodhana, carry out this order, and all our desires will be fulfilled.  Following the instructions of the King, Duryodhana made arrangements for many pavilions to be erected along the road to Hastinapura. They were decorated with garlands, pictures, costly silks, and rugs of the finest quality. The finest foods were prepared, and the finest drinks were set aside for Lord Krishna. It was opulence on the level of the heavenly denizens and was meant to bring the Lord of the Universe to the Kaurava's side. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna, did not even cast His glance upon the arrangements of Duryodhana. He stopped at intervals of His Own choosing, and very soon He arrived at Hastinapura.

These external acts have revealed your real intention. The Pandavas desire five villages, but you don't want to give them even that. You want to win over the Lord of the Yadu dynasty to your own side by means of wealth. You want to separate Krishna from the Pandavas. I will tell you, however, that you will be unable, by wealth, or attention, or worship, to separate Lord Krishna from Dhananjaya. Keshava will accept from you only a vessel of water for washing His feet and inquiries about His welfare. Other than this, He will not accept your hospitality, for it is saturated with deception. If you actually want to please Krishna, then you should give him what He has come for. After receiving the kingdom due to the Pandavas, He will accept all that you offer Him.

Your race, owing to its learning and behavior, is most distinguished among the royal dynasties. Joy in seeing others happy, unhappiness at the sight of other's sorrow, sincerity, forgiveness, and truthfulness,-these qualities, O Bharata, prevail amongst the Kurus. Since you are the chief of the Kuru dynasty, you should be the first to restrain one who does not show these virtues. You should know that those wicked sons of yours, headed by Duryodhana, have abandoned virtue, morality and religion-for they behave inimically towards their relatives, the Pandavas. If you are indifferent to your son's actions, it will cause the destruction, of not only your dynasty, but the destruction of all the warrior races of the world. The establishment of peace depends on our joint decision, O descendent of Bharata. If you correct your sons, then they must obey your commands, and if I give orders to the Pandavas, then they will obey My command. If you are backed by the mighty Pandavas, then who in the three worlds could defeat you. If Pandu's sons and your sons are united, then there is no power on this earth that can destroy them. There will be no profit if all the earthly kings are destroyed. There will be no profit if your sons lie prostrate on the battlefield, their life extinguished from their bodies.

He has tried to unclothe their beloved queen, and this is all with your consent. Still, Yudhisthira is desiring a peaceful solution. It is your duty to give back to the Pandavas the kingdom that is theirs, and thus put a halt to the massacre of the world's population. The decision is yours.

Lord Krishna then instructed the Kuru elders, All the Kuru family members seem to possess the same mentality, or else why don't you bind this iniquitous person and kill him. I think the time has come for this. In order to save the Bhoja dynasty from the hands of the sinful Kamsa, I killed him, and again enthroned his father Ugrasena. By killing a single person, the whole dynasty has now prospered. To save the Kuru dynasty from extinction, you should seize Duryodhana, Karna, Shakuni and Duhshasana. Binding them with ropes, you should hand them over to the Pandavas. Do not allow the whole warrior race to be slaughtered on one person's account.

When the Pandavas have heard that Keshava has been taken prisoner, they will lose their spirit, and in that condition, it will be easy to kill them.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter Three|Lord Krishna Instructs the Assembly of Kings|False|"When those unscrupulous demons had resolved to carry out their fool hearty plan, Satyaki came to know of it, for he can read the heart of any man. He ordered Kritavarman to array his troops outside the palace and be ready for action. Then, entering the court, he informed Lord Krishna, Dhritarastra and Vidura of the sinister plot. Duryodhana soon entered the court intending to carry out his foolish plan. Seeing him coming, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Master of all mystics, addressed him, From illusion, O Duryodhana, you think Me alone, and therefore, desire to make Me a prisoner. Here, however, are all the Pandavas, the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. Here are all the Adityas, the Rudras and the Vasus.  Saying this, Lord Krishna burst into a loud laughter. From His body came, like a river, the host of heavenly lords, each appearing like lightning. From His forehead appeared the four headed Brahma, and from His chest appeared Lord Shiva. From His arms appeared the great kings of the world. From His mouth, like fire, appeared Agni, the Adityas, the Sadhyas, the Vasus, the Asvins, the Marutas, with Indra and the Visvadevas. From Lord Krishna's two arms came Lord Balarama and Arjuna. Arjuna stood on His right, with Gandiva in hand and Balarama on His left with the club and plough in hand. Behind Him stood Yudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva. Before Lord Krishna stood the Yadus, headed by Pradyumna, all with upraised weapons. Lord Krishna manifested manifold arms, each with a weapon shining with great radiance. From His eyes, nose and ears came sparks of fire like the the rays of the sun. Duryodhana could not look upon this supremely effulgent form, and all the Kings closed their eyes out of fear. Only Bhishma, Drona, Vidura and the sages present were able to behold this divine manifestation of the universal form. From the firmament the heavenly denizens showered flowers, and the sounds of kettledrums and conches sounded in all directions. When all the earthly Kings had been bewildered, Lord Krishna withdrew His universal form. Then, accompanied by Satyaki and Kritavarman, He walked past the stupid Duryodhana and left Dhritarastra's palace. All the Kuru elders followed Him to His chariot, and upon ascending it, Lord Krishna again advised them, You have witnessed how the uncivilized son of Dhritarastra has ignored the advice given to him. What is there left to say? Prepare yourselves for war. With your permission, I shall now return to Yudhisthira.  Lord Krishna then left the palace grounds and headed for Vidura's residence.

5|Udyoga Parva|Chapter Three|Lord Krishna Instructs the Assembly of Kings|True|"This chapter is very instructive on the quality of pure devotion. Lord Krishna went to Hastinapura to make peace. Duryodhana's plan was to induce Lord Krishna to take his side. He want to alure the Lord with material comforts. However, Lord Krishna is not attracted to material benefits for he already owns all material things. He, therefore, rejected Duryodhana's offers and went to the house of Vidura where there was pure devotion. This example should be instructive to us that we cannot buy Lord Krishna with material things. All we can do is saturate our offering with as much love and devotion as we have. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya mam abhijanati, yavan yas casmi tattvatah, tato mam tattvato jnatva, visate tad-anantaram, One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.  (B.g. 18.55)

The nature of demons is that they will never accept good counsel. Duryodhana's mentality was leading him to a hellish condition. It is the duty of everyone to control lust, anger and greed. Lord Krishna advises this in Bhagavad-gita, tri-vidham narakasyedam, dvaram nasanam atmanah, kamahkrodhas tatha lobhas, tasmad etat trayam tyajet, There are three gates leading to this hell-lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.  (B.g. 16.22)

Lord Krishna gave them direct instructions to bind Duryodhana and turn him over to the Pandavas or kill him. Bhishma was a great devotee, a mahajana, so why didn't he follow the Lord's instructions? Aren't pure devotees always subordinate to the will of the Lord? The answer is yes; pure devotees are always under yogamaya, and therefore, it must be seen that Bhishma and other Kuru elders, who were devotees, were bewildered and could not act because of yogamaya. In other words the Lord's mission was to reduce the military burden of the world, and if Bhishma and the others had acted, then the battle of Kurukshetra would have never taken place.

Lord Krishna revealed the truth to him, O son of Radha, you have worshiped the brahmanas who have realized the truth of the Vedas. Therefore, you know what is the Vedic conclusion regarding the birth of a child. In the past you have not known who your real mother was. This remains a mystery to you. Actually you were born to Kunti before her marriage to Pandu. Your father is the sun god. The daughter of Surasena had received a benediction from Durvasa Muni that she could call any heavenly lord from the higher planets to conceive a child. In her youthful innocence, she called for the sun god, and because the mantra could not prove fruitless, a child was conceived. Out of fear that she would never be able to marry, she placed the child in a basket and cast it afloat on the Ganges. Thus, you are actually known as Kaunteya. The Pandavas are, in reality, your younger brothers. If you come to their side, they will bow at your feet, and you will become the emperor of the world. When you are coronated as King of the earth, Yudhisthira will stand behind you in your chariot. Bhimasena will hold the royal umbrella over your head, and Arjuna will hold the reins of the chariot. Nakula and Sahadeva, as well as Draupadi's five sons, will walk behind you. Let the Pandavas proclaim, Victory to Vasusena.' Surrounded by the Pandavas, you will appear like your father, the sun god, followed by his many assistants.

After a few moments of silence, Karna said, Without a doubt, O Keshava, I believe that your words are truth. From the moral and Vedic understanding, I am the son of Kunti by the Sun god, Vivasvan. I can understand that from the command of Surya, Kunti was forced to abandon me in the Ganges. This is certainly my past history. Why was she so cruel as to have abandoned me in the Ganges to die? What kind of mother is this? When I was found in the Ganges by Adiratha and Radha, they took me into their home and cared for me. Out of affection for me, Radha's breast filled with milk, and she cleaned the urine and stool from my body. My father, Adhiratha, caused all the purificatory performances to be performed by qualified brahmanas. Thus they bestowed upon me the name Vasusena. I have married wives according to his selection, and by them I now have sons and grandsons. O Krishna, my bonds of affection and love are fixed on them. O Govinda, I cannot destroy this affection by means of gold or the whole earth. Duryodhana has been kind to me all these years, and I have shared his kingdom for the last thirteen years. How can I give him up? If I become victorious in battle, then I shall hand over this kingdom to Duryodhana. Without doubt, O slayer of Madhu, You have given me good advice. With You on the chariot of Arjuna, there will be little chance of our victory. If Yudhisthira comes to know that I am the first born son of Kunti, he will not accept the throne. With You as his guide, he is fit to rule this world, assisted by Arjuna and Bhimasena. For the offense I committed in the gambling match to my younger brothers and their queen, I shall lay on the battlefield slain by Arjuna. I shall witness the second son of Pandu, Bhimasena, drink the blood of Duhshasana on the field of battle. Those great heroes of the Kuru race, Bhishma and Drona, shall fall from their chariots, slain by the sons of Drupada, Shikhandin and Dhristadyumna. Before the end of this great struggle for lordship of the earth, everyone will witness Duryodhana slain by Bhima's mace.

Dhritarastra's hundred sons headed by yourself are all rathis, out of which you are the most powerful. Then, O King, come myself, the leader of your troops. I will not speak of my own prowess, for I am already known to you. The foremost wielders of weapons, Kritavarman, the chief of the Bhojas, is an adirathi. He will greatly assist you in this battle, and cannot be humiliated by the enemy. The ruler of Madras, Salya, in my opinion is a maharathi. He will fight with the other maharathis on the Pandava side. He will resemble the ocean as it heads toward the beach. The mighty bowman, Bhurisravas, the son of Somadatta, is a maharathi, and he will certainly create havoc amongst the enemy troops. The King of Sindhu, Jayadratha, is equal to two rathis. He has acquired a benediction from Lord Shiva that he can defeat the Pandavas in battle, and he is therefore reckless with his life. Sudhakshina, the ruler of the Kambhojas, is in my judgement equal to a single rathi. Coming from the province of Mahismati, King Nila, is one of your great rathis. The Kings of Avantipura, Vinda and Anuvinda, are considered to be excellent rathis. These two heroes will consume the enemy troops with spiked darts and maces. The Trigarta brothers headed by Susharman are all single rathis. They are distinguished warriors and will fight with the best soldiers on the Pandava's side.

His troops are known for their prowess and will cut down the enemy troops like the wind. The mighty bowman, Ashvatthama, the son of Drona, is a maharathi. Like Arjuna, he can release arrows with such rapidity that they touch one another in flight. If he desires, he can destroy the whole world. There is, however, one defect in him for which I do not consider him a rathi or a maharathi. This person is too attached to the bodily conception of life, and therefore, does not want to die. Still he is powerful and can be compared to Yamaraja himself. The son of Bharadwaja, Drona, will achieve victory in many battles for your pleasure. Endowed with unsurpassable prowess, he can single-handedly fight, by means of his celestial weapons, all the heavenly lords, Gandharvas and human beings together. That illustrious warrior is a great maharathi. Vrishasena, the son of Karna, is one of the celebrated chariot warriors. He is to be considered a maharathi. That person who never retreats in battle and resembles Yamaraja himself, Bahlika, is in my judgement an adiratha. That cruel chief of the rakshasas, Alambhusha is a maharathi. He can surpass all the rakshasa warriors in the use of weapons. The ruler of Pragjyotisha, the heroic Bhagadatta, is also considered a adiratha. Riding on his elephant Supritika, he will annihilate the enemy forces. Regarding your dear friend, Karna, Surya's son, who is proud of his skill and who is devoid of any good sense, in my judgement he is neither a rathi or an adiratha. He has been stripped of his natural coat of mail and his celestial earrings by Indra. He has been cursed by his teacher, Parashurama, and also by a brahmana. When he challenges Arjuna, he will not leave the battlefield with his life. Therefore, he is, in my judgement, half a rathi.

His chariot will ride above the ground like the chariots of the celestial heavenly gods. Bhimasena, O King, is regarded to equal eight rathis. He is endowed with the vitality of ten thousand elephants, and with a mace in hand there is none equal to him. Those two bulls among men, the twin sons of Madri, are great rathis. They equal in beauty and prowess the two Asvini-kumaras. Regarding Arjuna, who has Lord Narayana as his charioteer, there is none amongst the warriors on both sides who can be his equal. Indeed, even amongst the gods and demons, there is none his equal. The chariot on which Arjuna will fight is celestial and cannot be destroyed. The monkey that rides on the banner is also divine and cannot be slain. The Gandiva bow and the two inexhaustible quivers of Partha were given to him by Varuna. He has obtained all the celestial weapons from the heavenly gods, including the thunderbolt weapon and the Pashupati astra. Only myself and Drona can challenge him. However, he is young and skillful, whereas we are old and our energy is easily spent.

Virata's son, Uttara Kumara is considered a great rathi. The mighty-armed Abhimanyu is as great a maharathi as Arjuna himself. Remembering his father's sufferings, he will slaughter the troops on your side. Satyaki, the descendant of Sini, is an esteemed chariot fighter and must be regarded as a maharathi. Uttamauja and Yudhamanyu are also great chariot fighters. They will fight recklessly, not considering their lives. They are in my opinion great rathis. The aged Kings, Virata and Drupada, both endowed with outstanding prowess, are maharathis. Though advanced in years they will combat the greatest warriors. Shikhandi, the son of Drupada, is, O King, one of Yudhisthira's foremost maharathis. Formerly he was a woman. In battle he will earn great fame. The great warrior, Dhristadyumna, is in my judgement a adirathi. He took birth from the sacrificial fire for the sole purpose of slaying Drona. His prowess is invincible. Dhristaketu, the heroic leader of the Chedis, the son of Shishupala, is a maharathi. The subjugator of the enemy, Kunitbhoja, the maternal uncle of the Pandavas, is in my opinion an adirathi. That prince of the rakshasas, Ghatotkacha, O King, born of Hidimva and Bhima, is in my opinion a mighty maharathi.

Once upon a time, when I saw that my brother Vichitravirya was ready for marriage, I went to the kingdom of Kashi and abducted the King's three beautiful daughters from the svayamvara ceremony. The names of these princesses were Amba, Ambika, and Ambalika. Taking them by force, I defeated all who opposed me, including King Salwa. When I arrived in Hastinapura, I bestowed those three beautiful princesses upon Vichitravirya. However, the eldest of the princesses, Amba, informed me that during the Svayamvara she had already chosen Salwa for her lord. She pleaded with me to allow her to go to his kingdom. In consultation with my mother and the brahmanas, I agreed to let her go. She went to Salwa's kingdom, but he rejected her and sent her out of his palace. She then went to the forest to practice austerities, but the great sages told her to go back to her father. She then informed them of all that had happened, and they advised her to speak to Parashurama, my preceptor. It so happened that in due course of time the son of Jamadagni, Parashurama, came to the sage's ashrama. When that powerful hero heard what had happened to her, he felt sympathy and said he would help her. He called for me requesting, This girl has been touched by you, and now even King Salwa will not take her. You should now save her by accepting her in marriage.' I replied to my martial guru, I cannot marry this girl to my brother, since she has chosen Salwa for her lord. She pleaded with Salwa, but he has rejected her. What can I do? I have taken a vow of celibacy, and that vow I will not break.' Parashurama then gave me the choice, either to marry the girl or fight with him. Since I could not agree to marry her, I chose to fight with my preceptor, although I tried to appease his anger with sweet words.

When Lord Shiva was satisfied with her, he appeared before her and informed her that in her next life she would be born as the King Drupada's son and would cause my death.

He then disappeared from that place. In due course Drupada's queen gave birth to a beautiful girl with lotus eyes. They named her Shikhandi. The queen told everyone that a boy had taken birth, remembering the promise of Lord Shiva. This secret was kept for many years. When it came time for Shikhandi to be married, Drupada arranged for the daughter of Hiranyavarman, the King of the Dasarnakas, to be his wife. A wedding ceremony was arranged, but when Hiranyavarman's daughter came to know in due course that Shikhandi was a woman, she informed her father of the fraud. Outraged and feeling humiliated, Hiranyavarman gathered a huge army to attack King Drupada. When Drupada came to know of this, he felt like a thief caught in the act. However, remembering Lord Shiva's promise, he sent word to Hiranyavarman that the rumor was not true. In the meantime, he prepared himself for war. When Shikhandi found out the suffering her parents were going through, she left the city to end her life by fasting. She soon found a forest that was owned by a powerful yaksha. No human beings were allowed to go there. Despite this she roamed the forest and upon seeing a beautiful mansion, she entered it and began to perform austerities. The owner of the mansion, a yaksha named Stunakarna, saw her and asked why she was fasting. Shikhandi then told him everything. The yaksha, feeling compassion, promised to give her his manhood for a certain time. Both agreed and Shikhandi left the yaksha's mansion as a man, and the yaksha became a woman. Shikhandi returned to Drupada's capital and told her father about the temporary manhood. Drupada excitedly sent news to King Hiranyavarman and invited him to inspect his son regarding his manhood. King Hiranyavarman sent to Drupada's city many beautiful women who inspected Shikhandi and confirmed that he was a man. They told the King of the Dasarnakas that Shikhandi was actually a male, and the King again made friends with Drupada.

Lamenting the death of Abhimanyu and the sons of Draupadi, I feel victory to be defeat. What will Subhadra say to me? The lamentation of Draupadi is more than I can bear. It was after the slaughter of all these men that I came to know that Karna was my brother. He was born of the union of the Sun god and my mother Kunti. He was regarded by the whole world to be the son of Radha, but in actuality, he was my mother's eldest son. I have, unknowingly, caused him to be slain. This is burning my limbs like fire burns a heap of cotton. Neither Arjuna nor Bhima nor the twins knew him to be our eldest brother. However, he knew that we were his younger brothers. He was informed of this by Lord Krishna and my mother. Because of his close ties with Duryodhana, he could not come to our side. He did, however, agree not to take our lives. If I could have had both Arjuna and Karna, I could have conquered over any of the great maharathis. During the gambling match, even though provoked by Karna's words, I became pacified by his sight. He always seemed to resemble our mother in many ways. I tried to find out the reason for the likeness, but I never came to any conclusion. O Narada, why has the earth swallowed up his chariot wheels?

If, renouncing the duties of a King, you would lead a life of idleness, then this massacre of Dhritarastra's sons was uncalled for. Are forgiveness, compassion, and non violence not to be found among those of the kshatriya race? If we had known that after this great battle, you would have renounced the kingdom, then we would have never slain a single creature. We would have lived in the forest till the demise of this body. Wise men, acquainted with the duties of a kshatriya, say that those, who unrighteously steal another's property or unlawfully usurp the throne, should be slain. Duryodhana and his followers were guilty of this fault and thus they have been killed. O Yudhisthira, govern this world righteously. It has been laid down that a life of renunciation should be adopted only in times of distress. A king should only lead a life of renunciation when he is decrepit or devoid of his kingdom. Men of wisdom, therefore, do not sanction renunciation as the duty of a kshatriya. You are, O Monarch, conversant with all duties. There is nothing that is not known to you. We always wish to imitate your conduct, but we cannot do so.

One who gives in charity to the brahmanas, who are conversant with Vedic knowledge, leads a life of true renunciation. That king, who neglects his citizens and does not give them protection, is the very embodiment of Kali. If you do not give protection to the citizens, then you will incur sin. As the ancient kings before you have performed their duties, so should you also perform your duty.

Turning to her husband she replied, I have a very dear friend named Jitavati who is the daughter of the sage Usinara. I wish to take this cow and calf as a present for her.'

1|Adi Parva|Chapter One|Maharaja Shantanu Marries the Celestial Ganga|True|"Maharaja Shantanu lived in the age of the Dvapara yuga, more than five thousand years ago. He was a saintly King who cared about his citizens and sought their welfare. Time passes through four ages; the first being the Satya yuga which is compared to spring time. In this age persons have long lives and are very much inclined toward meditation and austerity. The Treta yuga is compared to the summer time. In this age people are very pious and there are hardly any stringent miseries. The Dvapara age is like autumn time. Material miseries become apparent and the principles of religion decline. The age we are living in now is the age of kali, which is compared to the winter season. Most people are not inclined toward spiritual life, and because of this they suffer stringent material miseries. They commit grossly sinful acts for which they suffer life after life. The history of the earth, before the Kali age, is recorded in such Vedic literatures as the Puranas, Mahabharata, and Ramayana. These divinely inspired literatures are filled with histories of saintly emperors who protected their citizens, endeavoring to elevate them to the platform of God realization. This Mahabharata is a factual historical account of what happened on earth thousands of years ago.

(Bg.3.10) Advanced human society centered on God realization has been existing since the beginning of creation. In fact, the Puranas are historical records of civilizations more advanced than the one to. The people and civilizations of this present age, Kali yuga, have actually diminished in good qualities as confirmed in the Shrimad Bhagavatam, ""O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.  (S.B. 1.1.10) This is a quotation by Saunaka rishi to the sages of Naimisharanya.

In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna states, ""From Me comes knowledge, remembrance and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known. I am the compiler of Vedanta and, indeed, I am the knower of the Vedas.  (B.g. 15.15) Lord Krishna is the Supreme Godhead and the Supreme Authority. Because He is God, He knows everything about the past, present and future. What is written in the Puranas is His account of the past. Therefore, if we accept His statements as they are handed down in disciplic succession and understood by the spiritual master, then we can have perfect knowledge of the past without having to waste billions of dollars on mental speculation. This Mahabharata is an emanation from that Supreme Being, and was compiled by Shrila Vyasadeva who was empowered for this exact purpose.

The skeptics will say that it is impossible not to make a mistake in handing down disciplic knowledge, because of man's imperfection. However, a bona fide spiritual master does not have the imperfection of mortal senses. How is this? Because a pure devotee of God is being directed by the Lord in the heart, his senses become as good as the Lord's. Pure devotees of God may differ in implementing God's will according to time, place and circumstance, but the conclusion of the teachings is the same. In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna states, ""The Supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings received it in that way. But in the course of time the succession was broken, and, therefore, the science as it is appears to be lost.  (B.g. 4.2) The disciplic succession was broken when Duryodhana became king, and therefore Lord Krishna had to reestablish it by removing Duryodhana and establishing Maharaja Yudhisthira as a saintly king, able to carry on the disciplic succession.

For good works done in a previous life, we prosper in this life. God is not so cruel as to allow some to enjoy and others to suffer. The living being is the cause of his or her own happiness and distress.

Ksatriyas usually have many wives and  hundreds of children. This was not uncommon in the previous ages. Because ksatriyas are in the mode of passion, it was almost impossible for them to control sex desire, which is the cause of all bondage to this world. They, therefore, took many wives and maintained them in great opulence. Bhishma was a great devotee of the Lord and because of his devotion to the lotus feet of the Lord, he was able to make a life-long celibacy vow, rejecting the feminine beauty of this world. By keeping the seminal fluid within, a man increases in strength, memory, intelligence and duration of life. This is one reason why Bhishma was destined to become the most powerful of the great warriors.

Young girls were never allowed to walk the streets searching for a husband. It was the duty of a father to get his daughter married at a young age. The sex desire becomes very prominent when a young girl reaches puberty. If she is married at that time, this will save her from becoming a prostitute. In Vedic times, if a girl was even touched by another man, no one would marry her. Wives were chosen on the basis of chasity and purity. It has become a social custom in the western world for young girls to mingle freely with young boys and often lose their virginity before marriage.  these girls become pregnant and give birth to unwanted children. The young girl, bereft of a husband, has to fend for herself, which may lead her to further sinful activities. The child born out of such lust generally turns out to be a useless member of society, and no one can understand why our youth are becoming degraded. This is all due to ignorance of God's law concerning the social organization of human society.

The pain that they inflicted by aborting the innocent child in the womb will come back to them in a future birth.

One may say that this has nothing to due with pure devotional service, and in fact it doesn't. However, we learned from the previous chapter that Bhishma, as the Vasu, Dyu, was cursed by Vashistha Muni to not have female companionship while living as an ordinary mortal. His vow was simply a fulfillment of that curse, and had nothing to do with any fruitive desire of his own. Also, Bhishma was a great devotee and was under the influence of Krishna's Yogamaya potency. In other words, this situation set the scene for the Lord's forthcoming appearance and would play a role for instructing the whole world.

He challenged Bhishma, ""Wait!, Wait!  Bhishma flamed up in anger and turned to meet the challenge of the oncoming monarch. All the princes, who had been defeated, assembled to see the battle between those two bulls among men. King Salwa first covered Bhishma with many golden arrows. All the assembled princes applauded Salwa's prowess, but Bhishma was furious and told his charioteer, ""Take me closer to Salwa's chariot, so I may kill him in the way Garuda kills a serpent.  The Kuru chief then fixed the varuna weapon to his bow, and releasing it put Salwa's horses into confusion. This weapon caused a tidal wave to appear. Showing his supremacy with the bow, Bhishma released a flaming arrow which killed Salwa's charioteer. The powerful son of Shantanu then released the aindra weapon which killed Salwa's horses. (This weapon is similar to a modern  machine gun, but is more powerful and more accurate.) As the battle continued, Bhishma shattered all the weapons of Salwa, but left him with his life. After defeating all opponents, Bhishma proceeded to Hastinapura and offered the beautiful princesses to his younger brother.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Three|Bhishma Abducts Three Princesses|True|"Maharaja Shantanu wanted to be enlightened in self realization and factually know the difference between the body and the soul. The soul takes one body after another according to the sinful or pious activities of this life. Emperor Shantanu wanted to stop the repetition of birth and death by becoming fully absorbed in God consciousness. Not only did he himself take spiritual realization seriously, but he also instructed his citizens about the life's ultimate aspiration. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna tells Arjuna, ""O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is my opinion.  (B.g. 13.3) Because spiritual knowledge is the zenith of wisdom, Vedic civilization centered on this point, and therefore was considered more progressive than the present civilizations in which knowledge of the external body is given primary importance. Any civilization that doesn't teach the difference between the body and the soul is an animal civilization, no matter how materially advanced. The animals simply eat, sleep, mate and defend, and any civilization that teaches these animalistic propensities as life's prime goal cannot obtain spiritual perfection. As Lord Jesus Christ states, ""Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all things will follow.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Three|Bhishma Abducts Three Princesses|True|"When both Chitrangada and Vichitravirya died, there was lamentation by all the family members. Happiness in this material world is temporary. Everyone wants an eternal lover, father, mother, friend, son or daughter. We are eager to have a lover eternally, but the lover grows old and is no longer appealing to the mind. We are always eager to have a parent-child relationship, but the son grows up, or as in this case the son dies. We are very eager to have a friend, but we find that the friend moves to a distant country or we are cheated in personal dealings. And the relationship of master and servant is broken by mistrust. The temporary relationships in this world are like drinking sweet rice mixed with sand. The nice taste of the sweet rice is there, but the sand particles make it unpalatable. Similarly, the relationships of this material world are only temporarily pleasing, because the sand particles of birth, death, old age and disease make it unpalatable. In the spiritual world, however, one can have Krishna as a lover eternally, as in the case of the Gopis of Vrindavana. Mother Yashoda and Nanda Maharaja enjoy having Krishna as their son eternally. In the spiritual world one can play with Krishna as a cowherd boyfriend eternally. One can have God as his master eternally and never feel cheated. Therefore this material world is only a mirror reflection of the spiritual world. If you place a banana in front of a mirror and try to eat the mirror reflection, you will be frustrated. Similarly if we try to enjoy the temporary relationships of this world, we will be frustrated. We have to reestablish our loving relationship with the Supreme Lord, and then we will be happy and never have to lament as did the queens of Vichitravirya.

That is how one advances in spiritual life. Both Bhishma and Parashurama are in the category of liberated associates of the Lord. Parashurama is an shaktavesha avatara [an empowered living entity], and Bhishma was a pure devotee of the Lord, one of the twelve mahajanas. This pastime was arranged by the internal potency of the Lord and therefore cannot be imitated. The four Kumaras were liberated devotees, and they disobeyed the order of their father, Brahma, when he requested them to get married and beget progeny. The conditioned soul cannot imitate these pastimes and disobey the order of the spiritual master. It is stated by Vishvanatha Chakravarty Thakur that by pleasing the spiritual master one pleases God, and by displeasing the spiritual master one displeases God. We have personally seen during the life of our spiritual master that certain disciples fell down from the path of devotional service by displeasing the spiritual master.

Not only did he kill the followers of Kartavirya Arjuna, but he destroyed the entire kshatriya race twenty-one times. When the earth was devoid of great warriors, the queens approached the great rishis and procreated children by them and thus the kshatriya race was revived. Therefore, a purified brahmana should be invited with an offer of wealth, and let him raise children by the wives of Vicitravirya.

Attachment is found even in the families of great dynasties. Maya is so strong that one thinks that his family members will live eternally and that he or she will never die. Queen Kunti was born in a royal dynasty descending from the moon god. Her sons were all born of great demigods and were highly qualified. She understood her attachment was not proper, and therfore she prayed in the presence of Lord Krishna, ""O Lord of the universe, soul of the universe, O personality of the form of the universe, please sever my tie of affection for my kinsmen, the Pandavas and the Vrishnis.  (Bhag. 1.8.41) There is nothing wrong with affection and attachment, but we must owe our greatest affection to God first. Queen Kunti concluded her prayers to Lord Krishna, ""O Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto You without being diverted to anyone else.  (Bhag. 1.8.42) Or as Lord Jesus Christ put it, ""I have not come to this earth to bring peace, but a sword, I will turn the father against the son and the mother against the daughter.

They knew that if they died on the field of battle facing the enemy, they would attain a higher destination after this life. Therefore, they were fearless in battle. As the iron age of Kali progressed, the warrior kings lost their strength and heroism. To armies no longer face each other in battle, but hide in trenches and behind trees, fearful of death. They are not conviced that there is another life after this one. Gone are the s of these chivalrous warriors, because everyone in this Kali age is fastly becoming a shudra. The modern leaders of the world do not have a heroic fighting spirit, and thus they do not come out on the field of battle to lead their forces. They sit in their offices thousands of miles away from the battlefield. Even the modern  generals do not lead their forces into battle, but direct them miles away from the front line.

In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, there is the following verse, asvamedham gavalambham, sannyasam pala-paitrikam, devarena sutopattim, kalau panca vivarjayet, ""In the age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyasa, the offerings of flesh to the forefathers, and a man's begetting children in his brother's wife.  [Brahma-vaivarta Purana, Krishna-janma-khanda 185.180] In the Kali-yuga the offering of a cow or horse in sacrifice is forbidden because the brahmanas are no longer qualified. The brahmanas would first kill a cow or horse by mantra, and then by another mantra bring it back to life with a new body. This power of mantra has been lost in the Kali-yuga, and therefore the act is forbidden. When the brahmanas could not bring the animal back to life, they continued with the sacrifices, considering the animal meat as the prasad or mercy of the Lord. In this way meat eating began in Vedic culture. It was for this reason that the Lord incarnated as Buddha, saving the the poor animals from slaughter. He stopped all Vedic sacrifice by preaching the philosophy of ahimsa or nonviolence.

They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and above all always disturbed.  [Bhag. 1.1.10] In India it has become popular to accept the renounced order of life simply to fill one's belly. This has give a very bad name to the sannyasa order, and people no longer have respect for that ashrama. These so-called renunciates have sex with many women and are more like monkeys than sannyasis. Because people are generally in the modes of passion and ignorance, it is not possible for them to accept the renounced order of life and follow the strict rules and regulations of that order. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu accepted the renounced order of life at the age of twenty-four. He did so to deliver the fallen condition souls. Only a person who has transcended the modes of passion and ignorance, and is firmly established in goodness can become a sannyasi, strictly following the regulative principle of no sex.

With some anxiety in his heart, he requested Kunti, ""For the world's protection and to preserve the Bharata dynasty, I want you to procreate children by a highly advanced brahmana. Without powerful children to maintain the Kuru dynasty, the whole world may fall into ruin. Also, one has a debt to pay to his ancestors by begetting good children.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Six|The Pandavas are Born|True|"In the beginning of this chapter the glories of Maharaja Bhishma are extoled. He was a leader par excellence. Lord Krishna tells Arjuna in the Bhagavad-gita, ""Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.  (Bg. 3.21) Because Maharaja Bhishma was a powerful devotee and saintly king, the citizens wanted to follow in his footsteps. By engaging in the Lord's devotional service, the citizens automatically became joyful and radiant. This process is like watering the root of a tree. If the water is applied to the root, then the whole tree prospers. Similarly, if a king engages his citizens in worshipping Lord Vishnu, the root of all creation, then automatically they become happy.

Directing our life toward sense gratification is like trying to water the leaves of the tree individually. The whole tree dies from such a watering process. The citizens in Maharaja Bhishma's kingdom loved him as a father, and always extoled his qualities and activities. They knew that Maharaja Bhishma would not utilize them for his sense gratification; for they truly believed that he was God's representative on Earth, and he never let them down in that regard. In to's society, no one trusts the leaders. They now travel in bullet proof cars to protect themselves from the discontented citizens whom they have exploited. Such is the difference between a self motivated leader and a godly king like Maharaja Bhishma.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Six|The Pandavas are Born|True|"When Gandhari was married to Dhritarastra, she voluntarily blindfolded herself for the rest of her life. Gandhari was the ideal chaste woman of all time. She did not want to feel superior to her husband in any way. The ornament of a woman is her chastity or faithfulness to her husband. In the Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krishna told Arjuna, ""Among women I am fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence, faithfulness (chastity) and patience.  (Bg.10.34) A woman, who is chaste to her husband, is elevated in transcendental qualities. In the modern world, chasity is not emphasized. Women have been given independence in practically all matters. They can go to war, vote, head the household, or they can even lead a country. Because chastity is not in vogue, women are allowed to sample many men to find the right one according to their estimation. Many unwanted children are born out of such sampling. The whole situation degenerates the quality of the population, but what is to be done? We can only encourage everyone to chant the holy names of God and try to lead a pure life. The holy name alone can change the course of this age.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Six|The Pandavas are Born|True|"King Pandu possessed all the good qualities of a heroic and powerful king. The qualities of a brave warrior are given in Bhagavad-gita, ""Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity, and leadership are the qualities of work for the kshatriyas.  (Bg.18.43) Maharaja Pandu was decorated with these qualities. He ruled the earth toward the end of the Dvapara Yuga more than five thousand years ago. At that time society was guided by the divine varnashrama system. As Lord Krishna states in Bhagavad-gita, ""According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable.  (Bg.4.13) The four divisions of society are the brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the vaishyas and the shudras. The priestly class was meant to guide all other classes of men in spiritual knowledge. The warrior kings were meant to protect the citizens so that they could peacefully execute their prescribed duties. The mercantile and farming men were meant to till the land, take care of cows and do business. The worker class were meant to serve the other three sections of society. There was no exploitation of one class over another, because the common goal was to please Lord Vishnu. When God is placed in the center of civilization, everyone becomes happy and prosperous, and there is no artificial dominance of one section of society over another.

When the brahmanas lost their power, the kshatriyas became the leaders of society. This is like having a body without a head. The result of this was that the population in general forgot the aim of life+spiritual realization+and gradually became influenced by sensual monarches who simply engaged in the pursuit of material pleasure.

Within the last one hundred years, monarchies have been abolished for the most part. Why? Because the kings became corrupt. They were no longer saintly leaders, but degraded rogues and thieves. Gradually the mercantile men threw out the powerless kings and instituted democracy, or government run by the people. The businessmen and the workers are now competing with one another for the supremacy of the world. There is no trust because the leaders are simply self motivated. Everyone has forgotten the goal of life, self realization, and as a result people are confused and bewildered. As the businessmen become more degraded, the worker class will take power. Modern communism is a government for the worker class. As Kali yuga progresses, all governments will be run by men with base qualities, leading to nothing but anarchy, or no government at all.

They have none of the heroic qualities mentioned in Bhagavad-gita. They do not know how to protect the citizens properly, nor do they know how to respect saintly persons. They are like Kali, who dressed like a king, but was found beating a bull and cow. Maharaja Parikshit, a real king, appeared on the spot to kill the pretender.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Six|The Pandavas are Born|True|"When Maharaja Pandu pierced the deer, he did not know that it was a disguised sage named Kindama. The sage had stated to Maharaja Pandu that unrestricted sex was not allowed in human society. At that time in Vedic culture it was understood that this one desire binds all persons to the material world. While Lord Rishabhadeva was instructing his one hundred sons, he told them, ""The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of I and mine.' (Bhag. 5.5.8) Unrestricted sex life is simply animal life, and it is for this reason that the sage took the body of a deer so he could enjoy like an animal. When a person engages in too much sex, he considers himself to be this body and this life to be all in all. One comes to the human platform when sex life is regulated for producing saintly children. If one is serious about getting out of this material world, one must refrain from four sinful activities: unrestricted sex, meat eating, indulging in intoxication and gambling. After giving these up, one must engage in the devotional service of the Lord in nine different categories: Hearing, chanting and remembering the Supreme Lord, serving His lotus feet, offering prayers, serving Him, worshipping His deity form, making the Lord one's friend and surrendering everything to Him. If one is absorbed in this nine-fold process, he will realize his eternal nature and liberate himself from the path of birth and death.

They all sat down to a feast before swimming. Duryodhana brought Bhima a cake filled with enough poison to kill one hundred men. That wicked youth, who spoke sweetly, but whose heart was like a razor, continued to feed Bhima different kinds of food that were filled with poison. After the feast the boys began playing in the water. Bhima became fatigued from the poison, and rising from the water, lay down on the ground. Seizing this opportunity, Duryodhana and some of his brothers bound him with ropes and threw him into the Ganges. He sank down to the bottom of the river where the Naga (snake) kingdom is situated. Thousands of Nagas began to bite him, and the poison from the cake was neutralized by the serpents' venom.

Lord Krishna speaks to Arjuna in the sixteenth chapter of Bhagavad-gita about this state of mind. Lord Krishna says, ""The demoniac person thinks, So much wealth do I have to, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.' In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.  (Bg.13.13-15) Because Duryodhana was puffed up and arrogant, he had no appreciation for the spiritual qualities of the Pandavas.

This mantra weapon was more powerful than the combined atomic weapons of the world. It could be directed to a single person or it could destroy the whole universe. There were many weapons invoked by the power of Vedic mantras; they were called astras. These astras manipulated the material energy in a subtle way and were much more powerful than the atomic weapons of our times. There were astras such as the vayavya astra, which created a hurricane on the battlefield; the varuna astra, which created tidal waves; and the agneya astra, which created intense fire capable of burning large numbers of warriors. There were weapons capable of putting men to sleep and weapons that could bind the enemy soldiers and stop their movement. There were weapons that could release thousands of arrows at a time and not one arrow would miss a target. There were these and many more. This was all possible by the use of Vedic mantras. These mantras were able to manipulate the material energy by the use of sound vibration as opposed to the gross manipulation used to. Any of the great maharathis in the s of yore would be a suitable match for crude tanks, howitzers, submarines, battleships and atomic weapons.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Eight|The Preceptor Drona|True|"As Kali yuga progressed, the warrior kings gradually diminished in strength to the point where they were unable to draw the strings of powerful bows. The knowledge of different astras became lost, and a warrior was reduced to releasing one arrow at a time and with not much accuracy or force. Finally, a few centuries back, the cross bow was invented, which allowed an archer to mechanically draw back the string. However, this was not very useful because a bowman could not release many arrows quickly. The bow and the arrow became obsolete with the invention of gunpowder. To compensate the loss of strength, the rifle was invented, which, by the use of gun powder, released a bullet with great velocity.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Nine|The Curse of Parashurama|True|"Materialistic people are very worried about their status in society. If one takes a high birth, he or she is considered fortunate by common people. In this world there is always competition to get to the top. Those on top want to push down those who are rising. Those, who are at the bottom, strive to climb to the top. Therefore, there is always friction. Fortunately, God does not care for our pedigree. He is attracted only to loving devotion. The rich man or poor man, the black or white, the man or woman, the young or the old, all have an equal opportunity to approach the Lord. Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad-gita, ""One can understand the Supreme Person as He is, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Lord by such devotion, he can enter the kingdom of God.  (Bg. 18.55) Queen Kunti considered it an impediment to have a high birth. In her prayers to Lord Krishna she states, ""My Lord, Your Lordship can be easily approached, but only by those who are materially exhausted. One who is on the path of material progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with sincere feeling.  (Bhag. 1.8.26) As long as one is trying to advance materially, one will experience frustration. There is only one person at the top and that is Lord Krishna. We should just desire to remain the servant of His humble servant.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Nine|The Curse of Parashurama|True|"When Karna was cursed by his guru, karma took its effect. Nothing happens by accident. Everyone in this material world is under the law of Karma--action and reaction. It is impossible to tell where it begins or where it ends. For every action we perform, there is an opposite and equal reaction. If a person performs a sinful act, he gets a sinful reaction. If he performs a pious act, he gets a pious reaction. Sinful or pious actions cause us to take birth again in this world. Karna was suffering the reactions to past sinful activities, and they took the shape of curses from great personalities. The only way to stop the waves of repeated birth and death is to become Krishna conscious. Fortunately for Karna, he died on the battlefield with his vision fixed on Lord Krishna and Arjuna. Thus, ultimately, he was elevated and purified of all the offences he had committed against the Pandavas. As confirmed by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita (8.5), ""And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Nine|The Curse of Parashurama|True|"Another point to be learned from this chapter is that a person should be judged by his quality and not by his birth. Karna's birth was celestial, his father being Surya and his mother being Kunti. Although he was rasied by lower caste parents, his quality was that of a kshatriya or warrior. He should have been accepted by his quality and not by the caste which he was raised in. Narada Muni states in the Shrimad Bhagavatam, ""If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, kshatriya, vaisya or sudra, as described above, even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification (Bhag. 7.11.35). Drona should not have rejected Karna on the basis of his foster parents. He should have judged him by quality. It is a fact that in the glorious s of Vedic culture a person born of a particular caste had the qualities of that caste, but there are always exceptions to the rule, and Karna was an exception.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Ten|The Tournament of Arms|True|"When Duryodhana was chastising Bhima for considering Karna's birth, it seems that for once in his life Duryodhana spoke some truth. A person was placed in the divine varnashrama (caste) system by quality and not by birth. In the fourth chapter of Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna says that he created the divine varnashrama system according to quality of work. Generally, in those s a person of priestly quality, warrior quality, business quality or worker quality took birth in their respective classes. However, as the age of Kali (quarrel) progressed, men born in priestly families exhibited lower class qualities but were not put into those classes due to their pride. Also saintly persons were born in lower families, but not allowed to elevate themselves socially due to the pride of the priestly class. When this happened the whole system collapsed. One should be classified by quality and not by birth. Here Duryodhana states that Karna had the quality of a warrior, and therefore he should be held in esteem as a warrior. Although what Duryodhana said was truth, he was motivated by his own ambitions. If it had suited his purpose for Karna to be called a chariot driver, he would not have hesitated to award him that classification.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Ten|The Tournament of Arms|True|"In all societies and countires these classifications exist. Some men are naturally inclined toward priestly activities; some are inclined to be warriors and fight; some men are attracted to business, farming or banking; and some men are interested in labor activities. In the Vedic culture some 5,000 years ago civilization was set up along these lines of brahmana (priest), kshatriya (warrior), vaishya (merchantile) and shudra (labor). There was also four divisions of ashrama or spiritual life. The first division was brahmacharya where a student was trained in spiritual and material knowledge. The brahmana, kshatriya and vaishya were trained in spiritual knowledge and received the brahmincal initiation or sacred thread as an indication of second birth or reformation of character. This teaching was given to instill in a person that the goal of life was not to be happy in this earthly realm, but to prepare oneself for entering the kingdom of God. The laboring class was not given this training due to their inability to control the senses. The student training lasted for different amounts of time according to a person's classification. The vaishya spent till his twelfth year in his guru's ashrama. The kshatriya could spend more years, say to this fifteeth year, and the brahmana could staty with his guru till his 24th year, and if he remained a brahmacharya, he could spend the rest of his life in the ashrama.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Ten|The Tournament of Arms|True|"The next division was the grihasta ashrama where the student took permission from his teacher and married according to his classification. The marriage institutition was called an ashrama because it was meant for spiritual cultivation and not just to enjoy the senses. Marriage was mandatory for all classes except the brahmanas who could accept the order of sannyasa without going through the different stages. The third stage was vanaprastha or retired life. In this stage the children are grown and married. The man and woman visit different places of pilgrimage for spiritual upliftment and detachment. The brahmana, kshatriya and vaishya can accept this order. The last stage is the sannyasa ashrama where the husband leaves the wife with the eldest son and dedicates his life to preaching the glories of the Lord. This ashrama was meant for the brahmana class only. This may sound cruel by western standards, to leave the wife behind, but the reward is very great. If the husband attains perfection by gaining birth in the kingdom of God, the wife automatically attains that positon. This is the greatest gift a husband can give his wife. This ashrama was held in high esteem by the people in general, because the sannyasis or itenerant preachers were decorated with spiritual qualities such as compassion, austerity, forgiveness, learning and sense control.

As Bhima glanced over his mother and his brothers, he felt a deep pain in his heart. After all it was just a night ago that they were sleeping in the finest beds, and eating the finest foods. Did Queen Kunti, the wife of the great Pandu and the daughter of King Surasena, deserve to lie on the bare ground? Did the sister of Vasudeva and the mother of the Pandavas deserve leaves as a bed sheet? Yudhisthira, the son of Yamaraja, was lying on the bare ground. Did he deserve such a fate? Did he not deserve sovereignty of the three worlds? Did Arjuna, the greatest bowman the world has ever known, deserve to lie on the ground like an ordinary man? Did Nakula and Sahadeva, who are like demigods in appearance, deserve to be soiled by the dust of the earth? Bhima then spoke as if the sons of Dhritarastra were present, ""You sons of Dhritarastra have little foresight. You wicked fellows may enjoy your temporary success. You still breathe only because Yudhisthira does not command me to take your lives. If ordered by him, I would send you all to the region of Yamaraja this very !

There are eight kinds of marriage ceremonies mentioned in the vedas. They are brahma, arsha, prajapatya, daiva, Gandharva, asura and Rakshasa. Draupadi was married to Arjuna in the Gandharva style which means that the suitor had to exhibit his prowess before the would be bride. The word svayamvara means placing the garland on the neck of the future husband. Before Arjuna could receive the garland of Draupadi, he had to pass the test of piercing the eye of the fish. Krishna married the beautiful Satya, the daughter of King Nagnajit, in the same style when He had to wrestle with seven bulls and defeat them.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Fifteen|The Svayamvara of Draupadi|True|"A majority of the marriages that take place presently are based simply on physical attraction and sexual compatibility, and therefore, when there is some disturbance to the physical beauty, like aging, or sexual incompatibility, there is divorce. Unrestricted sex life will cause one to lose respect for the partner. Therefore, in Vedic culture sex was allowed for the purpose of procreation. If a man could not control his sex drive, he was allowed to take more than one wife, but unrestricted sex was not allowed even in marriage.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Fifteen|The Svayamvara of Draupadi|True|"In present times, degradation of the marriage institution has come about because of too much free mingling between men and women. The animals do not have a marriage institution. The male monkey will go from female to female whenever the urge arises, which is quite often. If a human being ignores marriage vows and simply goes from one woman to another, then he is no better than a monkey in mentality. In his next life he becomes an animal and fulfills his desires for unrestricted sex.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Fifteen|The Svayamvara of Draupadi|True|"In Vedic times men and women were not allowed to mingle freely. The boys and girls were restricted in their association. When the British conquered India, they highly criticized the marriage of women at an early age before their puberty. They called it child marriage. The actual fact is that a youthful marriage is very good for chastity. The husband is usually ten years older than the female. If the girl is ten or twelve, then the male is twenty or twenty-two. The girl does not live with her husband immediately, but her mind is fixed on one man. By service and association she develops an attraction only for her husband, and her husband develops an attraction only for his young wife. In this way the girl will never have sex with any other male. So many problems in society are solved by chasity between husband and wife.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Fifteen|The Svayamvara of Draupadi|True|"From the grand arrangements of the marriage ceremony of Draupadi, one can glimpse the richness of Vedic culture. Marriage at that time was something magnificent. In Vedic age there was no divorce. Before the marriage the partners were chosen on the basis of like personalities. A man who was brahminically (priestly) inclined was married to a woman who had a similar attraction. A man with kingly qualities was married to a woman of a similar nature. The same was true for the merchants and worker class. An astrological reading was taken to see if the marriage was compatible and would last through the whole life. This type of marriage was more stable than the present system where it is left up to the girl and boy to search out their partners. Not taking into consideration like mentalities, they marry on the basis of physical attraction. The divorce rate in the western world is over fifty percent, showing us that this type of marriage is not working. In fact no one is objecting, because men and women are liking the animal consciousness of unrestricted sex. Many of our troubles in society stem from this one problem.

The answer is that brahmanas were generally thin due to not eating often. In fact B hima had become slender due to not living the lavish style of kingly life. Generally, brahmanas also kept their heads shaved with a sikha or tuft of hair on the head. Along with the simple dress of a brahmana, they were not to be recognized by the other kings present.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Sixteen|The Pandavas Marry Draupadi|True|"King Dhritarastra had planned to kill the Pandavas by burning them in a house of lac. This so-called reversal for the Pandavas turned out to be a benediction, because they acquired Draupadi as their wife, and they developed a more intimate friendship with Lord Krishna, the Supreme Person. They also acquired an alliance with the most powerful King Drupada. The devotees of the Lord never lament when reversals come upon them. They take these reversals as the mercy of God. As stated in the Shrimad Bhagavatam, ""One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You, is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation.  (S.B.10.14.8) This is part of Lord Brahma's prayers to Lord Krishna. Brahma offered prayers to Lord Krishna after he had been humbled by Lord Krishna's mystic potency. This quotation explains how we should accept reversals. When impediments come to a devotee, he does not complain, but continues his service to the Lord, knowing that he must be given a slight punishment for sins committed in the past. No harm can ever come to a devotee and even seeming reversals turn out favorable in the end.

By his mystic power Vishvakarma was able to construct a beautiful city that was dazzling in all respects. Vyasadeva was there to consecrate the new city with mantras from the Vedic hymns. The city was indeed beautiful with its nicely aligned roads and symmetrical houses. The mansions were made of first class marble, and the walls, inside and out, were embedded with precious gems. At different places within the city there were gardens of a transcendental nature. Within the gardens were small lakes decorated with different colors of lotus flowers. These gardens were filled with fruit trees of every description, and beautiful birds such as the peacock, cuckoo, parrots and chakravakas were seen here and there. When the city was complete, men and women from all classes came to live under the protection of the saintly sons of Pritha. All these citizens were pious and devoted to the cause of the Pandavas. With Lord Krishna living in the city as the most beautiful ornament, Indraprastha appeared like Vaikuntha, the spiritual world.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Eighteen|Arjuna Goes on Pilgrimage|True|"One may question how it is possible for a devotee like Arjuna to be attracte by so many women and at the same time be a pure devotee. The devotees of Lord Krishna cannot be swayed by lust; they are free from all material desires. The answer is that Arjuna was playing the part of a kshatriya (king). All kings were married even if they were pure devotees. The role of a king is that he must be an ideal householder. It was known that King Dasaratha, the father of Lord Ramachandra, had 350 wives, but one cannot say that he was a lusty person. It was common in those s that kings take a number of wives and support them in great opulence. The pure devotees of the Lord are always under the influence of the internal energy of the Lord (yogamaya). Arjuna apparently fell under the sway of family affection just before the Kurukshetra war. He didn't want to kill his relatives. That incident happened by the will of the Lord Krishna so the Bhagavad-gita could be spoken. Similarly, these pastimes of Arjuna are not like the lustful attraction men feel for women in this world, although they appear to be so. Arjuna's gusto to get Subhadra as his wife is because of her relationship to Lord Krishna. Arjuna's attraction for Krishna was far greater than the attraction of any woman of this world. An aspiring devotee cannot imitate Arjuna and at the same time think himself a follower of Lord Krishna. There is a class of people called sahajiyas who imitate Krishna's dancing with the gopis. They engage in illicit sex and at the same time think themselves liberated. Lord Krishna's rasa dance was free from any tinge of lust. We must be very careful in judging eternally liberated souls; we have to follow their instructions and not imitate them.

He offered obeisances to Agni and then forcefully strung the multi-colored bow. Whoever heard the twang of that bow was struck with fear. Varuna then gave the Sudarshana chakra to Lord Krishna.

All the living creatures in the forest were from demoniac species, and as they came out of the forest to escape the heat, they were killed by the arrows of Lord Krishna and Arjuna. As the flames rose in the forest, they seemed to reach the sky, and the demigods became alarmed. Indra, upon seeing the forest being consumed by Agni, caused dark clouds to appear over the region and pour torrents of rain. Water hit the fire causing the forest to be filled with smoke, and in combination with flashes of lightning, the forest became fearful to behold. Then the son of Pandu invoked his astras and covered the entire forest with his innumerable arrows that were as thick as fog.

1|Adi Parva|Chapter Nineteen|Devouring of the Khandava Forest|True|"The contents of this chapter are, seemingly, beyond our sensory experience. We can't imagine a person able to devour a forest by fire, because he ate too much ghee. This seems to be in the realm of mythology. However, the beings in charge of this universe are not ordinary mortals. They are beings empowered by the Supreme Lord. Just like the President has a cabinet to help him manage the government, so the Supreme Lord has administrators to help Him manage the universe. Beings like Brahma, Shiva, Indra, Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Surya and others are in charge of the universal elements. They are given powers capable of manipulating the material elements. However powerful they may seem, still, Lord Krishna is their origin. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita, ""Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.  (B.g. 10.2) These heavenly gods are not seen by the common person, especially in this age of Kali when people are devoid of good qualities.

The planets also have presiding deities. Soma rules the moon, Surya rules the Sun, etc. In order to administrate on behalf of the Lord, these beings are given super human powers not found on earth. They need these powers to do their job. The members of the presidential cabinet are given special powers by the president to do their jobs also. We should not be astonished to hear that a heavenly god devoured a forest by fire. Nothing is spectacular in relation to the Lord.

He doesn't struggle to create, maintain or annihilate this universe. He simple sets His energies into motion, and they do everything on His behalf. However, when Krishna descends to this earth, He does set an example for others to follow. ""O son of Pritha, there is no work prescribed for Me within all three planetary systems. Nor am I in want of anything, nor have I need of anything-- and yet I am engaged in work.  (B.g. 3.22) He also states in the ninth chapter of the Gita, ""This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.

However, God is God, and He can do whatever He likes. If He wants to create a pastime where He receives one of His weapons from Varuna, He is free to do so.

16|Mausala Parva|NA|The Curse Upon the Yadu Dynasty|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Shri Krishna, as well as His powerful brother, Balarama, executed the killing of many demons. The Yadu dynasty also helped in this regard. To further remove the burden of the earth, the Lord arranged for the great battle of Kurukshetra, which suddenly erupted in violence between the Kurus and the Pandavas. Previously, before the appearance of the Lord, He had ordered that the demigods appear in the pious families of the Yadus. However, some members of the Yadu dynasty saw the Lord as an ordinary human being. Because of their mundane vision of the Supreme Person, they considered themselves on the same level as the Lord. Because they took their birth in the Yadu dynasty, they had inconceivable strength, and thus they misunderstood Lord Krishna's supreme position. Having forgotten that Krishna was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they constituted a great burden. Consequently, it was then necessary for Lord Krishna to remove that burden from the face of the earth. Although many members, who were devoted to Krishna, died in this fratricidal war, they were returned to their original positions as universal demigods. Others, who were eternal associates of the Lord, returned to His Own abode. Thus the Lord fulfilled his promise in Bhagavad-gita that His devotee never perishes.

The Supreme Lord, Shri Krishna, used the Yadu dynasty, which was protected by His own arms, to eliminate the kings, who with their armies, had been a burden to this earth.

But what is this? There is still the invincible strength of the Yadu dynasty, born of Myself, which may be a more unbearable burden. No outside force could ever bring about the defeat of this family, the Yadu dynasty, whose members have always been fully surrendered to Me and are unrestricted in their opulence.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, is the reservoir of all beauty. His personal form is so attractive that it steals the eyes away from all other objects, which then seem devoid of beauty in comparison to Him. When Lord Shri Krishna was on the earth, He attracted the eyes of all people. When Krishna spoke, His words attracted the minds of all who remembered them. By seeing the footprints of Lord Krishna, people became attached to Him, and thus they desired to become His most obedient servants. In this way Krishna very easily spread His glories, which are sung throughout the world by the most sublime and essential Vedic verses. Lord Krishna considered that simply by hearing and chanting those glories, conditioned souls born in the future would cross beyond the darkness of ignorance. Being satisfied with this arrangement, He left for His desired destination.

The sages duly executed these rituals in the home of the chief Yadu, Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna. After Lord Krishna, who was staying in Vasudeva's home as time personified, respectfully sent the sages off at the conclusion of the ceremonies, they went to the holy place called Pindraka. While in that holy place, the princes of the Yadu dynasty had Samba, the son of Jambavati, dress up in a woman's garb. Playfully approaching the great sages gathered there, the princes grabbed hold of the sages' feet and impudently asked them, with feigned humility, ""O learned brahmanas, this black-eyed pregnant woman has something to ask you, She is too embarrassed to inquire for herself. She is just about to give birth and is very desirous of having a son. Since all of you are great sages with infallible vision, please tell us whether her child will be a boy or a girl.""

Speaking thus and being very disturbed, they returned to their homes, taking the club with them. The luster of their faces completely faded.

King Ugrasena thought to himself, ""Samba and others should not feel any shame or fear."" Thus without consulting Lord Shri Krishna, he ordered the club ground into fragments and thrown into the water, along with a small iron lump that remained. A certain fish swallowed the iron lump, and the bits of iron, carried to the shore by the waves, implanted themselves there and grew into tall, sharp canes. The fish was caught in the ocean along with other fish in a fisherman's net. The iron lump in the fish's stomach was taken by the hunter Jara, who fixed it as an arrowhead at the end of his shaft. Knowing fully the significance of all these events, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though capable of reversing the brahmana's curse, did not wish to do so. Rather, in His form of time, He gladly sanctioned the events.

Crows uttered inauspicious sounds within the houses of the Vrishnis, and they did not cease  or night. Many birds, impelled by death, appeared that were pale in complexion. Asses took birth from cows, and elephants took birth from mules. Cats were born of dogs, and mice took birth from the mongoose. The Vrishnis committed sinful acts and did not feel any shame upon doing so. They showed disregard for the brahmanas, demigods and the deities.

Also tell them of my present condition. You and your family members should not remain in Dvaraka, because once I have abandoned that city, it will be inundated by the ocean. Whatever family members are left should be gathered together, and under Arjuna's protection leave for Indraprastha. My dear Daruka, you should be firmly fixed in devotion to Me. Remain fixed in spiritual knowledge and unattached to material considerations. Understanding these pastimes to be a display of My illusory potency, You should remain peaceful."" Thus ordered, Daruka circumambulated the Lord and offered obeisances to Him again and again. He placed Lord Krishna's lotus feet on His head, and then with a sad heart went back to the city.

Upon reaching Dvaraka, Arjuna learned of the destruction of the Yadu Dynasty and the disappearance of the Lord. Proceeding to the city of the Vrishnis, Arjuna saw the city to be like a woman bereft of her husband. Seeing that Partha had come to protect them, the ladies sent up loud wails. Arjuna became greatly afflicted upon seeing the many wives of Lord Krishna without their protector. Rukmini and Satya fell down on the ground next to Arjuna and uttered loud cries of grief. Arjuna then began to glorify the superhuman activities of the Lord, and thus he managed to pacify them to some extent. He then proceeded to see his maternal uncle Vasudeva. Arjuna found the father of Lord Krishna lying on the ground and burning in separation from his son. Upon seeing Arjuna, Vasudeva embraced him and wept aloud remembering Lord Krishna. Vasudeva said, ""Without beholding my son who subjugated the whole earth and defeated the Daityas a hundred times, I do not desire to live. No doubt the curse of the rishis is the cause of the destruction of this dynasty. How could the slayer of Madhu look on with indifference at the slaughter of His kinsmen. Yourself, Narada and the rishis know Him to be the eternal Lord Vishnu. My son must have allowed all this to happen. He is the Lord of the universe. He did not, however, wish to falsify the curses of Gandhari and the rishis. Thinking of My two sons and of the destruction of my Kinsmen, I am abstaining from food or drink. I shall neither eat nor live. You should now accomplish all that Krishna wanted you to do. This kingdom with all its wealth and women is now yours.

I will sever your limbs and send you to the abode of Yamaraja."" Enraged, Arjuna endeavored to string the Gandiva bow. However, he did so with great difficulty. The robbers disregarded Arjuna's command and continued to plunder the women of Dvaraka and its wealth. Arjuna then began to think of his celestial weapons, but they would not come to his mind. Beholding the loss of his strength and the non appearance of his weapons, he became ashamed. The Vrishni warriors were also not able to stop those robbers from taking away the women and the wealth. Arjuna managed to strike the robbers with arrows from his Gandiva bow, but soon his arrows became exhausted. In former s his shafts had been inexhaustible. Now, however, they proved otherwise. The son of Indra then began to strike the robbers with the horn of his bow, but the mlecchas, in the very sight of Partha, took away those ladies of the Vrishni and Andhaka dynasties.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter One|Observing the Armies|False|"Sanjaya said: O King, after looking over the army arranged in military formation by the sons of Pandu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and spoke the following words. O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple the son of Drupada. Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna: great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada. There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, Kasiraja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Saibya. There are the mighty Yudhamanyu, the very powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi. All these warriors are great chariot fighters. But for your information, O best of the brahmanas, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force. There are personalities like you, Bhisma, Karna, Krpa, Asvatthama, Vikarna and the son of Somadatta called Bhurisrava, who are always victorious in battle. There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science. Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhisma, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited. All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhisma, as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army. Then Bhisma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy. After that, the conchshells, drums, bugles, trumpets and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous. On the other side, both Lord Krishna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells. Lord Krishna blew His conchshell, called Pancajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell, called Paundra. King Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conchshell, the Ananta-vijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosa and Manipuspaka. That great archer the King of Kasi, the great fighter Sikhandi, Dhrstadyumna, Virata, the unconquerable Satyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the others, O King, such as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conchshells. The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious. Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhrtarastra. At that time Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows. O King, after looking at the sons of Dhrtarastra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord Krishna these words. Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here, who desire to fight, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms. Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhrtarastra. Sanjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties. In the presence of Bhisma, Drona and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, Just behold, Partha, all the Kurus assembled here. There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his fathers-in-law and well-wishers. When the son of Kunti, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus. Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up. My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning. I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krishna, killer of the Kesi demon. I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krishna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness. O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield? O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? O maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth. What pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhrtarastra?Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra and our friends. What should we gain, O Krishna, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?O Janardana, although these men, their hearts overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends, why should we, who can see the crime in destroying a family, engage in these acts of sin?With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion. When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krishna, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrsni, comes unwanted progeny. An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down, because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped. By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated. O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell. Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts. Driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. Better for me if the sons of Dhrtarastra, weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield. Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Two|Contents of the Gita Summarized|False|"Sanjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion, his mind depressed, his eyes full of tears, Madhusudana, Krishna, spoke the following words. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy. O son of Prtha, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy. Arjuna said: O killer of enemies, O killer of Madhu, how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhisma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship?It would be better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers. Even though desiring worldly gain, they are superiors. If they are killed, everything we enjoy will be tainted with blood. Nor do we know which is better-conquering them or being conquered by them. If we killed the sons of Dhrtarastra, we should not care to live. Yet they are now standing before us on the battlefield. Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me for certain what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me. I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous, unrivaled kingdom on earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven. Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Krishna, ""Govinda, I shall not fight,"" and fell silent. O descendant of Bharata, at that time Krishna, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead. Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed. O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation. Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent [the material body] there is no endurance and of the eternal [the soul] there is no change. This they have concluded by studying the nature of both. That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul. The material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is sure to come to an end; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata. Neither he who thinks the living entity the slayer nor he who thinks it slain is in knowledge, for the self slays not nor is slain. For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain. O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, eternal, unborn and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones. The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind. This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same. It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable and immutable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body. If, however, you think that the soul [or the symptoms of life] is always born and dies forever, you still have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed. One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to take birth again. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament. All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all. O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body can never be slain. Therefore you need not grieve for any living being. Considering your specific duty as a ksatriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation. O Partha, happy are the ksatriyas to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets. If, however, you do not perform your religious duty of fighting, then you will certainly incur sins for neglecting your duties and thus lose your reputation as a fighter. People will always speak of your infamy, and for a respectable person, dishonor is worse than death. The great generals who have highly esteemed your name and fame will think that you have left the battlefield out of fear only, and thus they will consider you insignificant. Your enemies will describe you in many unkind words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful for you?O son of Kunti, either you will be killed on the battlefield and attain the heavenly planets, or you will conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom. Therefore, get up with determination and fight. Do thou fight for the sake of fighting, without considering happiness or distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat-and by so doing you shall never incur sin. Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of Prtha, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works. In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear. Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched. Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this. In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place. The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self. All purposes served by a small well can at once be served by a great reservoir of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them. You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty. Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga. O Dhananjaya, keep all abominable activities far distant by devotional service, and in that consciousness surrender unto the Lord. Those who want to enjoy the fruits of their work are misers. A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions even in this life. Therefore strive for yoga, which is the art of all work. By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord, great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world. In this way they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries [by going back to Godhead]. When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard. When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have attained the divine consciousness. Arjuna said: O Krishna, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and how does he walk?The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Partha, when a man gives up all varieties of desire for sense gratification, which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind, thus purified, finds satisfaction in the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness. One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind. In the material world, one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain, neither praising it nor despising it, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge. One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness. The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness. The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them. One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of steady intelligence. While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises. From anger, complete delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost one falls down again into the material pool. But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord. For one thus satisfied [in Krishna consciousness], the threefold miseries of material existence exist no longer; in such satisfied consciousness, one's intelligence is soon well established. One who is not connected with the Supreme [in Krishna consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man's intelligence. Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence. What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage. A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires-that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still-can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires. A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego-he alone can attain real peace. That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Three|Karma Yoga|False|"Arjuna said: O Janardana, O Kesava, why do You want to engage me in this ghastly warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions. Therefore, please tell me decisively which will be most beneficial for me. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are two classes of men who try to realize the self. Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service. Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection. Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment. One who restrains the senses of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender. On the other hand, if a sincere person tries to control the active senses by the mind and begins karma-yoga [in Krishna consciousness] without attachment, he is by far superior. Perform your prescribed duty, for doing so is better than not working. One cannot even maintain one's physical body without work. Work done as a sacrifice for Vishnu has to be performed, otherwise work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage. In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Vishnu, and blessed them by saying, ""Be thou happy by this yajna [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you everything desirable for living happily and achieving liberation.""The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you, and thus, by cooperation between men and demigods, prosperity will reign for all. In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yajna [sacrifice], will supply all necessities to you. But he who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief. The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin. All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajna [sacrifice], and yajna is born of prescribed duties. Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice. My dear Arjuna, one who does not follow in human life the cycle of sacrifice thus established by the Vedas certainly leads a life full of sin. Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain. But for one who takes pleasure in the self, whose human life is one of self-realization, and who is satisfied in the self only, fully satiated-for him there is no duty. A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being. Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme. Kings such as Janaka attained perfection solely by performance of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work. Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues. O son of Prtha, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems. Nor am I in want of anything, nor have I a need to obtain anything-and yet I am engaged in prescribed duties. For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties, O Partha, certainly all men would follow My path. If I did not perform prescribed duties, all these worlds would be put to ruination. I would be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all living beings. As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, the learned may similarly act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path. So as not to disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive results of prescribed duties, a learned person should not induce them to stop work. Rather, by working in the spirit of devotion, he should engage them in all sorts of activities [for the gradual development of Krishna consciousness]. The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature. One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences between work in devotion and work for fruitive results. Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached. But the wise should not unsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers' lack of knowledge. Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with full knowledge of Me, without desires for profit, with no claims to proprietorship, and free from lethargy, fight. Those persons who execute their duties according to My injunctions and who follow this teaching faithfully, without envy, become free from the bondage of fruitive actions. But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not follow them are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and ruined in their endeavors for perfection. Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows the nature he has acquired from the three modes. What can repression accomplish?There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects. One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. It is far better to discharge one's prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another's duties perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one's own duty is better than engaging in another's duties, for to follow another's path is dangerous. Arjuna said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force?The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure consciousness becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization. The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence. Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence [Krishna consciousness] and thus-by spiritual strength-conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Four|Transcendental Knowedge|False|"The Personality of Godhead, Lord Shri Krishna, said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku. This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost. That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is to told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend and can therefore understand the transcendental mystery of this science. Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvan is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?The Personality of Godhead said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form. Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion-at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium. One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna. Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me-and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me. As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha. Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world. According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me. And although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable. There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work. All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding of My transcendental nature. Therefore you should perform your duty, following in their footsteps. Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be liberated from all misfortune. The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is. One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among men, and he is in the transcendental position, although engaged in all sorts of activities. One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every endeavor is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker for whom the reactions of work have been burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge. Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and independent, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of undertakings. Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions, and acts only for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by sinful reactions. He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from duality and does not envy, who is steady in both success and failure, is never entangled, although performing actions. The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence. A person who is fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature. Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some of them offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman. Some [the unadulterated brahmacaris] sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of mental control, and others [the regulated householders] sacrifice the objects of the senses in the fire of the senses. Others, who are interested in achieving self-realization through control of the mind and senses, offer the functions of all the senses, and of the life breath, as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind. Having accepted strict vows, some become enlightened by sacrificing their possessions, and others by performing severe austerities, by practicing the yoga of eightfold mysticism, or by studying the Vedas to advance in transcendental knowledge. Still others, who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, practice by offering the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Others, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice. All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reactions, and, having tasted the nectar of the results of sacrifices, they advance toward the supreme eternal atmosphere. O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?All these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas, and all of them are born of different types of work. Knowing them as such, you will become liberated. O chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than the mere sacrifice of material possessions. After all, O son of Prtha, all sacrifices of work culminate in transcendental knowledge. Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth. Having obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words, that they are Mine. Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries. As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities. In this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who has become accomplished in the practice of devotional service enjoys this knowledge within himself in due course of time. A faithful man who is dedicated to transcendental knowledge and who subdues his senses is eligible to achieve such knowledge, and having achieved it he quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace. But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not attain God consciousness; they fall down. For the doubting soul there is happiness neither in this world nor in the next. One who acts in devotional service, renouncing the fruits of his actions, and whose doubts have been destroyed by transcendental knowledge, is situated factually in the self. Thus he is not bound by the reactions of work, O conqueror of riches. Therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be slashed by the weapon of knowledge. Armed with yoga, O Bharata, stand and fight.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Five|Karma-yoga-Action in Krishna Consciousness|False|"Arjuna said: O Krishna, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial?The Personality of Godhead replied: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of work. One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced. Such a person, free from all dualities, easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna. Only the ignorant speak of devotional service [karma-yoga] as being different from the analytical study of the material world [Sankhya]. Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both. One who knows that the position reached by means of analytical study can also be attained by devotional service, and who therefore sees analytical study and devotional service to be on the same level, sees things as they are. Merely renouncing all activities yet not engaging in the devotional service of the Lord cannot make one happy. But a thoughtful person engaged in devotional service can achieve the Supreme without delay. One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and senses is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working, such a man is never entangled. A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping and breathing, always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, or opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them. One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water. The yogis, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification. The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled. When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither working nor causing work to be done. The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature. Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge. When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up everything in the time. When one's intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation. The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]. Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman. A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon obtaining something unpleasant, who is self-intelligent, who is unbewildered, and who knows the science of God, is already situated in transcendence. Such a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within. In this way the self-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the Supreme. An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them. Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is well situated and is happy in this world. One whose happiness is within, who is active and rejoices within, and whose aim is inward is actually the perfect mystic. He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme. Those who are beyond the dualities that arise from doubts, whose minds are engaged within, who are always busy working for the welfare of all living beings, and who are free from all sins achieve liberation in the Supreme. Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are self-realized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future. Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths within the nostrils, and thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the transcendentalist aiming at liberation becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in this state is certainly liberated. A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Six|Dhyana Yoga|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty. What is called renunciation you should know to be the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, O son of Pandu, for one can never become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification. For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who is already elevated in yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means. A person is said to be elevated in yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities. One must deliver himself with the help of his mind, and not degrade himself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well. For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his mind will remain the greatest enemy. For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquillity. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same. A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi [or mystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. He sees everything-whether it be pebbles, stones or gold-as the same. A person is considered still further advanced when he regards honest well-wishers, affectionate benefactors, the neutral, mediators, the envious, friends and enemies, the pious and the sinners all with an equal mind. A transcendentalist should always engage his body, mind and self in relationship with the Supreme; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness. To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The yogi should then sit on it very firmly and practice yoga to purify the heart by controlling his mind, senses and activities and fixing the mind on one point. One should hold one's body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life. Thus practicing constant control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic transcendentalist, his mind regulated, attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of Krishna] by cessation of material existence. There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough. He who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system. When the yogi, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in transcendence-devoid of all material desires-he is said to be well established in yoga. As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent self. In the stage of perfection called trance, or samadhi, one's mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This perfection is characterized by one's ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact. One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with determination and faith and not be deviated from the path. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of mental speculation and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind. Gradually, step by step, one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence sustained by full conviction, and thus the mind should be fixed on the self alone and should think of nothing else. From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the self. The yogi whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest perfection of transcendental happiness. He is beyond the mode of passion, he realizes his qualitative identity with the Supreme, and thus he is freed from all reactions to past deeds. Thus the self-controlled yogi, constantly engaged in yoga practice, becomes free from all material contamination and achieves the highest stage of perfect happiness in transcendental loving service to the Lord. A true yogi observes Me in all beings and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere. For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me. Such a yogi, who engages in the worshipful service of the Supersoul, knowing that I and the Supersoul are one, remains always in Me in all circumstances. He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!Arjuna said: O Madhusudana, the system of yoga which You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady. For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krishna, and to subdue it, I think, is more difficult than controlling the wind. Lord Shri Krishna said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by suitable practice and by detachment. For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by appropriate means is assured of success. That is My opinion. Arjuna said: O Krishna, what is the destination of the unsuccessful transcendentalist, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization with faith but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?O mighty-armed Krishna, does not such a man, who is bewildered from the path of transcendence, fall away from both spiritual and material success and perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?This is my doubt, O Krishna, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for You, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Son of Prtha, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil. The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy. Or [if unsuccessful after long practice of yoga] he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom. Certainly, such a birth is rare in this world. On taking such a birth, he revives the divine consciousness of his previous life, and he again tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete success, O son of Kuru. By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles-even without seeking them. Such an inquisitive transcendentalist stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures. And when the yogi engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, achieving perfection after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal. A yogi is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yogi. And of all yogis, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me-he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My opinion.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Seven|Knowledge of the Absolute|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Now hear, O son of Prtha, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt. I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, both phenomenal and numinous. This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know. Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth. Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego-all together these eight constitute My separated material energies. Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature. All created beings have their source in these two natures. Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution. O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread. O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man. I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics. O son of Prtha, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men. I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O lord of the Bharatas [Arjuna]. Know that all states of being-be they of goodness, passion or ignorance-are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything, but I am independent. I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me. Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible. This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it. Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, who are lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me. O best among the Bharatas, four kinds of pious men begin to render devotional service unto Me-the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute. Of these, the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me. All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me, the highest and most perfect goal. After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare. Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures. I am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity. Endowed with such a faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone. Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet. Unintelligent men, who do not know Me perfectly, think that I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is imperishable and supreme. I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible. O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows. O scion of Bharata, O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, bewildered by dualities arisen from desire and hate. Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination. Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities. Those in full consciousness of Me, who know Me, the Supreme Lord, to be the governing principle of the material manifestation, of the demigods, and of all methods of sacrifice, can understand and know Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even at the time of death.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Eight|Attaining the Supreme|False|"Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is the self? What are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are the demigods? Please explain this to me. Who is the Lord of sacrifice, and how does He live in the body, O Madhusudana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible, transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called adhyatma, the self. Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities is called karma, or fruitive activities. O best of the embodied beings, the physical nature, which is constantly changing, is called adhibhuta [the material manifestation]. The universal form of the Lord, which includes all the demigods, like those of the sun and moon, is called adhidaiva. And I, the Supreme Lord, represented as the Supersoul in the heart of every embodied being, am called adhiyajna [the Lord of sacrifice]. And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt. Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunti, that state he will attain without fail. Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Krishna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt. He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O Partha, is sure to reach Me. One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun, and He is transcendental, beyond this material nature. One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and, by the strength of yoga, with an undeviating mind, engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord in full devotion, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter omkara and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now briefly explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets. For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Prtha, because of his constant engagement in devotional service. After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection. From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth again. By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together form the duration of Brahma's one . And such also is the duration of his night. At the beginning of Brahma's , all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state, and thereafter, when the night falls, they are merged into the unmanifest again. Again and again, when Brahma's  arrives, all living entities come into being, and with the arrival of Brahma's night they are helplessly annihilated. Yet there is another unmanifest nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is. That which the Vedantists describe as unmanifest and infallible, that which is known as the supreme destination, that place from which, having attained it, one never returns-that is My supreme abode. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attainable by unalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him. O best of the Bharatas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which, passing away from this world, the yogi does or does not come back. Those who know the Supreme Brahman attain that Supreme by passing away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment of the , during the fortnight of the waxing moon, or during the six months when the sun travels in the north. The mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the fortnight of the waning moon, or the six months when the sun passes to the south reaches the moon planet but again comes back. According to Vedic opinion, there are two ways of passing from this world-one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns. Although the devotees know these two paths, O Arjuna, they are never bewildered. Therefore be always fixed in devotion. A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Nine|The Most Confidential Knowledge|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence. This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed. Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world. By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them. And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not a part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Self is the very source of creation. Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, all created beings rest in Me. O son of Kunti, at the end of the millennium all material manifestations enter into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency, I create them again. The whole cosmic order is under Me. Under My will it is automatically manifested again and again, and under My will it is annihilated at the end. O Dhananjaya, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached from all these material activities, seated as though neutral. This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again. Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be. Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated. O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible. Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion. Others, who engage in sacrifice by the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, as diverse in many, and in the universal form. But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors, the healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the offering. I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support and the grandsire. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable om. I am also the Rg, the Sama and the Yajur Vedas. I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed. O Arjuna, I give heat, and I withhold and send forth the rain. I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both spirit and matter are in Me. Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights. When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again. Thus those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three Vedas achieve only repeated birth and death. But those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form-to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have. Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunti, but they do so in a wrong way. I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices. Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down. Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me. If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it. Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform-do that, O son of Kunti, as an offering to Me. In this way you will be freed from bondage to work and its auspicious and inauspicious results. With your mind fixed on Me in this principle of renunciation, you will be liberated and come to Me. I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him. Even if one commits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination. He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes. O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth-women, vaisyas [merchants] and sudras [workers]-can attain the supreme destination. How much more this is so of the righteous brahmanas, the devotees and the saintly kings. Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world, engage in loving service unto Me. Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Ten|Opulence of the Absolute|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Listen again, O mighty-armed Arjuna. Because you are My dear friend, for your benefit I shall speak to you further, giving knowledge that is better than what I have already explained. Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin or opulences, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and sages. He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds-he only, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins. Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control of the senses, control of the mind, happiness and distress, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy-all these various qualities of living beings are created by Me alone. The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus [progenitors of mankind] come from Me, born from My mind, and all the living beings populating the various planets descend from them. One who is factually convinced of this opulence and mystic power of Mine engages in unalloyed devotional service; of this there is no doubt. I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts. The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are fully devoted to My service, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always enlightening one another and conversing about Me. To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me. To show them special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate abode, the purest, the Absolute Truth. You are the eternal, transcendental, original person, the unborn, the greatest. All the great sages such as Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa confirm this truth about You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me. O Krishna, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality. Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own internal potency, O Supreme Person, origin of all, Lord of all beings, God of gods, Lord of the universe!Please tell me in detail of Your divine opulences by which You pervade all these worlds. O Krishna, O supreme mystic, how shall I constantly think of You, and how shall I know You? In what various forms are You to be remembered, O Supreme Personality of Godhead?O Janardana, again please describe in detail the mystic power of Your opulences. I am never satiated in hearing about You, for the more I hear the more I want to taste the nectar of Your words. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless. I am the Supersoul, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all living entities. I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings. Of the Adityas I am Vishnu, of lights I am the radiant sun, of the Maruts I am Marici, and among the stars I am the moon. Of the Vedas I am the Sama Veda; of the demigods I am Indra, the king of heaven; of the senses I am the mind; and in living beings I am the living force [consciousness]. Of all the Rudras I am Lord Siva, of the Yaksas and Raksasas I am the Lord of wealth [Kuvera], of the Vasus I am fire [Agni], and of mountains I am Meru. Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief, Brhaspati. Of generals I am Kartikeya, and of bodies of water I am the ocean. Of the great sages I am Bhrgu; of vibrations I am the transcendental om. Of sacrifices I am the chanting of the holy names [japa], and of immovable things I am the Himalayas. Of all trees I am the banyan tree, and of the sages among the demigods I am Narada. Of the Gandharvas I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am the sage Kapila. Of horses know Me to be Uccaihsrava, produced during the churning of the ocean for nectar. Of lordly elephants I am Airavata, and among men I am the monarch. Of weapons I am the thunderbolt; among cows I am the surabhi. Of causes for procreation I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am Vasuki. Of the many-hooded Nagas I am Ananta, and among the aquatics I am the demigod Varuna. Of departed ancestors I am Aryama, and among the dispensers of law I am Yama, the lord of death. Among the Daitya demons I am the devoted Prahlada, among subduers I am time, among beasts I am the lion, and among birds I am Garuda. Of purifiers I am the wind, of the wielders of weapons I am Rama, of fishes I am the shark, and of flowing rivers I am the Ganges. Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth. Of letters I am the letter A, and among compound words I am the dual compound. I am also inexhaustible time, and of creators I am Brahma. I am all-devouring death, and I am the generating principle of all that is yet to be. Among women I am fame, fortune, fine speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness and patience. Of the hymns in the Sama Veda I am the Brhat-sama, and of poetry I am the Gayatri. Of months I am Margasirsa [November-December], and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring. I am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor. I am victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong. Of the descendants of Vrsni I am Vasudeva, and of the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Of the sages I am Vyasa, and among great thinkers I am Usana. Among all means of suppressing lawlessness I am punishment, and of those who seek victory I am morality. Of secret things I am silence, and of the wise I am the wisdom. Furthermore, O Arjuna, I am the generating seed of all existences. There is no being-moving or nonmoving-that can exist without Me. O mighty conqueror of enemies, there is no end to My divine manifestations. What I have spoken to you is but a mere indication of My infinite opulences. Know that all opulent, beautiful and glorious creations spring from but a spark of My splendor. But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Eleven|The Universal Form|False|"Arjuna said: By my hearing the instructions You have kindly given me about these most confidential spiritual subjects, my illusion has now been dispelled. O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity and have realized Your inexhaustible glories. O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see You here before me in Your actual position, as You have described Yourself, I wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours. If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that unlimited universal Self. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Prtha, see now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine and multicolored forms. O best of the Bharatas, see here the different manifestations of Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Asvini-kumaras and all the other demigods. Behold the many wonderful things which no one has ever seen or heard of before. O Arjuna, whatever you wish to see, behold at once in this body of Mine! This universal form can show you whatever you now desire to see and whatever you may want to see in the future. Everything-moving and nonmoving-is here completely, in one place. But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give you divine eyes. Behold My mystic opulence!Sanjaya said: O King, having spoken thus, the Supreme Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna. Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths, unlimited eyes, unlimited wonderful visions. The form was decorated with many celestial ornaments and bore many divine upraised weapons. He wore celestial garlands and garments, and many divine scents were smeared over His body. All was wondrous, brilliant, unlimited, all-expanding. If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form. At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands. Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna bowed his head to offer obeisances and with folded hands began to pray to the Supreme Lord. Arjuna said: My dear Lord Krishna, I see assembled in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahma sitting on the lotus flower, as well as Lord Siva and all the sages and divine serpents. O Lord of the universe, O universal form, I see in Your body many, many arms, bellies, mouths and eyes, expanded everywhere, without limit. I see in You no end, no middle and no beginning. Your form is difficult to see because of its glaring effulgence, spreading on all sides, like blazing fire or the immeasurable radiance of the sun. Yet I see this glowing form everywhere, adorned with various crowns, clubs and discs. You are the supreme primal objective. You are the ultimate resting place of all this universe. You are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest. You are the maintainer of the eternal religion, the Personality of Godhead. This is my opinion. You are without origin, middle or end. Your glory is unlimited. You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are Your eyes. I see You with blazing fire coming forth from Your mouth, burning this entire universe by Your own radiance. Although You are one, You spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between. O great one, seeing this wondrous and terrible form, all the planetary systems are perturbed. All the hosts of demigods are surrendering before You and entering into You. Some of them, very much afraid, are offering prayers with folded hands. Hosts of great sages and perfected beings, crying ""All peace!"" are praying to You by singing the Vedic hymns. All the various manifestations of Lord Siva, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Sadhyas, the Visvedevas, the two Asvins, the Maruts, the forefathers, the Gandharvas, the Yaksas, the Asuras and the perfected demigods are beholding You in wonder. O mighty-armed one, all the planets with their demigods are disturbed at seeing Your great form, with its many faces, eyes, arms, thighs, legs, and bellies and Your many terrible teeth; and as they are disturbed, so am I. O all-pervading Vishnu, seeing You with Your many radiant colors touching the sky, Your gaping mouths, and Your great glowing eyes, my mind is perturbed by fear. I can no longer maintain my steadiness or equilibrium of mind. O Lord of lords, O refuge of the worlds, please be gracious to me. I cannot keep my balance seeing thus Your blazing deathlike faces and awful teeth. In all directions I am bewildered. All the sons of Dhrtarastra, along with their allied kings, and Bhisma, Drona, Karna-and our chief soldiers also-are rushing into Your fearful mouths. And some I see trapped with heads smashed between Your teeth. As the many waves of the rivers flow into the ocean, so do all these great warriors enter blazing into Your mouths. I see all people rushing full speed into Your mouths, as moths dash to destruction in a blazing fire. O Vishnu, I see You devouring all people from all sides with Your flaming mouths. Covering all the universe with Your effulgence, You are manifest with terrible, scorching rays. O Lord of lords, so fierce of form, please tell me who You are. I offer my obeisances unto You; please be gracious to me. You are the primal Lord. I want to know about You, for I do not know what Your mission is. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people. With the exception of you [the Pandavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain. Therefore get up. Prepare to fight and win glory. Conquer your enemies and enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyasaci, can be but an instrument in the fight. Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, Karna and the other great warriors have already been destroyed by Me. Therefore, kill them and do not be disturbed. Simply fight, and you will vanquish your enemies in battle. Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the trembling Arjuna offered obeisances with folded hands again and again. He fearfully spoke to Lord Krishna in a faltering voice, as follows. Arjuna said: O master of the senses, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name, and thus everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this is rightly done. O great one, greater even than Brahma, You are the original creator. Why then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You? O limitless one, God of gods, refuge of the universe! You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation. You are the original Personality of Godhead, the oldest, the ultimate sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world. You are the knower of everything, and You are all that is knowable. You are the supreme refuge, above the material modes. O limitless form! This whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded by You!You are air, and You are the supreme controller! You are fire, You are water, and You are the moon! You are Brahma, the first living creature, and You are the great-grandfather. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You a thousand times, and again and yet again!Obeisances to You from the front, from behind and from all sides! O unbounded power, You are the master of limitless might! You are all-pervading, and thus You are everything!Thinking of You as my friend, I have rashly addressed You ""O Krishna,"" ""O Yadava,"" ""O my friend,"" not knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times, jesting as we relaxed, lay on the same bed, or sat or ate together,  alone and  in front of many friends. O infallible one, please excuse me for all those offenses. You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, of the moving and the nonmoving. You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. How then could there be anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall down to offer You my respectful obeisances and ask Your mercy. As a father tolerates the impudence of his son, or a friend tolerates the impertinence of a friend, or a wife tolerates the familiarity of her partner, please tolerate the wrongs I may have done You. After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe. O universal form, O thousand-armed Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in that form. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, happily have I shown you, by My internal potency, this supreme universal form within the material world. No one before you has ever seen this primal form, unlimited and full of glaring effulgence. O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by charity, nor by pious activities, nor by severe penances can I be seen in this form in the material world. You have been perturbed and bewildered by seeing this horrible feature of Mine. Now let it be finished. My devotee, be free again from all disturbances. With a peaceful mind you can now see the form you desire. Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, having spoken thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form and at last showed His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna. When Arjuna thus saw Krishna in His original form, he said: O Janardana, seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, I am now composed in mind, and I am restored to my original nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, this form of Mine you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear. The form you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am. My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding. My dear Arjuna, he who engages in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of fruitive activities and mental speculation, he who works for Me, who makes Me the supreme goal of his life, and who is friendly to every living being-he certainly comes to Me.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Twelve|Devotional Service|False|"Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect. But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed and immovable-the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth-by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me. For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied. But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of Prtha-for them I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death. Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt. My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way develop a desire to attain Me. If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage. If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness of Me, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated. If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind. One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me-such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me. He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by anyone, who is equipoised in happiness and distress, fear and anxiety, is very dear to Me. My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and not striving for some result, is very dear to Me. One who neither rejoices nor grieves, who neither laments nor desires, and who renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things-such a devotee is very dear to Me. One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contaminating association, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn't care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is engaged in devotional service-such a person is very dear to Me. Those who follow this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engage themselves with faith, making Me the supreme goal, are very, very dear to Me.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Thirteen|Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness|False|"Arjuna said: O my dear Krishna, I wish to know about prakrti [nature], purusa [the enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kunti, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is My opinion. Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the field of activities is, and what his influences are. That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings. It is especially presented in Vedanta-sutra with all reasoning as to cause and effect. The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten senses and the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions-all these are considered, in summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions. Humility; pridelessness; nonviolence; tolerance; simplicity; approaching a bona fide spiritual master; cleanliness; steadiness; self-control; renunciation of the objects of sense gratification; absence of false ego; the perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease; detachment; freedom from entanglement with children, wife, home and the rest; even-mindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant and unalloyed devotion to Me; aspiring to live in a solitary place; detachment from the general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization; and philosophical search for the Absolute Truth-all these I declare to be knowledge, and besides this whatever there may be is ignorance. I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world. Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has ears everywhere. In this way the Supersoul exists, pervading everything. The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all the modes of material nature. The Supreme Truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and the nonmoving. Because He is subtle, He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know. Although far, far away, He is also near to all. Although the Supersoul appears to be divided among all beings, He is never divided. He is situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all. He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone's heart. Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge and the knowable have been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and thus attain to My nature. Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature. Nature is said to be the cause of all material causes and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world. The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species. Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer, who is the Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known as the Supersoul. One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation. He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position. Some perceive the Supersoul within themselves through meditation, others through the cultivation of knowledge, and still others through working without fruitive desires. Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth and death. O chief of the Bharatas, know that whatever you see in existence, both the moving and the nonmoving, is only a combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field. One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies, and who understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul within the destructible body is ever destroyed, actually sees. One who sees the Supersoul equally present everywhere, in every living being, does not degrade himself by his mind. Thus he approaches the transcendental destination. One who can see that all activities are performed by the body, which is created of material nature, and sees that the self does nothing, actually sees. When a sensible man ceases to see different identities due to different material bodies and he sees how beings are expanded everywhere, he attains to the Brahman conception. Those with the vision of eternity can see that the imperishable soul is transcendental, eternal, and beyond the modes of nature. Despite contact with the material body, O Arjuna, the soul neither does anything nor is entangled. The sky, due to its subtle nature, does not mix with anything, although it is all-pervading. Similarly, the soul situated in Brahman vision does not mix with the body, though situated in that body. O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness. Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Fourteen|The Three Modes of Material Nature|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection. By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature like My own. Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation or disturbed at the time of dissolution. The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata. It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father. Material nature consists of three modes-goodness, passion and ignorance. When the eternal living entity comes in contact with nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he becomes conditioned by these modes. O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge. The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunti, and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material fruitive actions. O son of Bharata, know that the mode of darkness, born of ignorance, is the delusion of all embodied living entities. The results of this mode are madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul. O son of Bharata, the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion conditions one to fruitive action; and ignorance, covering one's knowledge, binds one to madness.  the mode of goodness becomes prominent, defeating the modes of passion and ignorance, O son of Bharata.  the mode of passion defeats goodness and ignorance, and at other times ignorance defeats goodness and passion. In this way there is always competition for supremacy. The manifestations of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge. O chief of the Bharatas, when there is an increase in the mode of passion the symptoms of great attachment, fruitive activity, intense endeavor, and uncontrollable desire and hankering develop. When there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, O son of Kuru, darkness, inertia, madness and illusion are manifested. When one dies in the mode of goodness, he attains to the pure higher planets of the great sages. When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when one dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom. The result of pious action is pure and is said to be in the mode of goodness. But action done in the mode of passion results in misery, and action performed in the mode of ignorance results in foolishness. From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, greed develops; and from the mode of ignorance develop foolishness, madness and illusion. Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds. When one properly sees that in all activities no other performer is at work than these modes of nature and he knows the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental to all these modes, he attains My spiritual nature. When the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes associated with the material body, he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even in this life. Arjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by which symptoms is one known who is transcendental to these three modes? What is his behavior? And how does he transcend the modes of nature?The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O son of Pandu, he who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present or long for them when they disappear; who is unwavering and undisturbed through all these reactions of the material qualities, remaining neutral and transcendental, knowing that the modes alone are active; who is situated in the self and regards alike happiness and distress; who looks upon a lump of earth, a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye; who is equal toward the desirable and the undesirable; who is steady, situated equally well in praise and blame, honor and dishonor; who treats alike both friend and enemy; and who has renounced all material activities-such a person is said to have transcended the modes of nature. One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman. And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Fifteen|The Yoga of the Supreme Person|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas. The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society. The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination one must cut down this strongly rooted tree with the weapon of detachment. Thereafter, one must seek that place from which, having gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything began and from whom everything has extended since time immemorial. Those who are free from false prestige, illusion and false association, who understand the eternal, who are done with material lust, who are freed from the dualities of happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to surrender unto the Supreme Person attain to that eternal kingdom. That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world. The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind. The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another. The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects. The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this. The endeavoring transcendentalists, who are situated in self-realization, can see all this clearly. But those whose minds are not developed and who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try to. The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me. I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables. I am the fire of digestion in the bodies of all living entities, and I join with the air of life, outgoing and incoming, to digest the four kinds of foodstuff. I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas. There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the material world every living entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every living entity is called infallible. Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Supreme Soul, the imperishable Lord Himself, who has entered the three worlds and is maintaining them. Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person. Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata. This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Sixteen|The Divine and Demoniac Natures|False|"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Fearlessness; purification of one's existence; cultivation of spiritual knowledge; charity; self-control; performance of sacrifice; study of the Vedas; austerity; simplicity; nonviolence; truthfulness; freedom from anger; renunciation; tranquillity; aversion to faultfinding; compassion for all living entities; freedom from covetousness; gentleness; modesty; steady determination; vigor; forgiveness; fortitude; cleanliness; and freedom from envy and from the passion for honor-these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature. Pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness and ignorance-these qualities belong to those of demoniac nature, O son of Prtha. The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demoniac qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of Pandu, for you are born with the divine qualities. O son of Prtha, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demoniac. I have already explained to you at length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac. Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them. They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control. They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust. Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world. Taking shelter of insatiable lust and absorbed in the conceit of pride and false prestige, the demoniac, thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent. They believe that to gratify the senses is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus until the end of life their anxiety is immeasurable. Bound by a network of hundreds of thousands of desires and absorbed in lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification. The demoniac person thinks: ""So much wealth do I have to, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice."" In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance. Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, they become too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and fall down into hell. Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they  proudly perform sacrifices in name only, without following any rules or regulations. Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and blaspheme against the real religion. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, O son of Kunti, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence. There are three gates leading to this hell-lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul. The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kunti, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination. He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination. One should therefore understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Seventeen|Divisions of Faith|False|"Arjuna inquired: O Krishna, what is the situation of those who do not follow the principles of scripture but worship according to their own imagination? Are they in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: According to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one's faith can be of three kinds-in goodness, in passion or in ignorance. Now hear about this. O son of Bharata, according to one's existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired. Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits. Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride and egoism, who are impelled by lust and attachment, who are foolish and who torture the material elements of the body as well as the Supersoul dwelling within, are to be known as demons. Even the food each person prefers is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature. The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity. Now hear of the distinctions between them. Foods dear to those in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one's existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such foods are juicy, fatty, wholesome, and pleasing to the heart. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry and burning are dear to those in the mode of passion. Such foods cause distress, misery and disease. Food prepared more than three hours before being eaten, food that is tasteless, decomposed and putrid, and food consisting of remnants and untouchable things is dear to those in the mode of darkness. Of sacrifices, the sacrifice performed according to the directions of scripture, as a matter of duty, by those who desire no reward, is of the nature of goodness. But the sacrifice performed for some material benefit, or for the sake of pride, O chief of the Bharatas, you should know to be in the mode of passion. Any sacrifice performed without regard for the directions of scripture, without distribution of prasadam [spiritual food], without chanting of Vedic hymns and remunerations to the priests, and without faith is considered to be in the mode of ignorance. Austerity of the body consists in worship of the Supreme Lord, the brahmanas, the spiritual master, and superiors like the father and mother, and in cleanliness, simplicity, celibacy and nonviolence. Austerity of speech consists in speaking words that are truthful, pleasing, beneficial, and not agitating to others, and also in regularly reciting Vedic literature. And satisfaction, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purification of one's existence are the austerities of the mind. This threefold austerity, performed with transcendental faith by men not expecting material benefits but engaged only for the sake of the Supreme, is called austerity in goodness. Penance performed out of pride and for the sake of gaining respect, honor and worship is said to be in the mode of passion. It is neither stable nor permanent. Penance performed out of foolishness, with self-torture or to destroy or injure others, is said to be in the mode of ignorance. Charity given out of duty, without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person is considered to be in the mode of goodness. But charity performed with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruitive results, or in a grudging mood, is said to be charity in the mode of passion. And charity performed at an impure place, at an improper time, to unworthy persons, or without proper attention and respect is said to be in the mode of ignorance. From the beginning of creation, the three words om tat sat were used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth. These three symbolic representations were used by brahmanas while chanting the hymns of the Vedas and during sacrifices for the satisfaction of the Supreme. Therefore, transcendentalists undertaking performances of sacrifice, charity and penance in accordance with scriptural regulations begin always with om, to attain the Supreme. Without desiring fruitive results, one should perform various kinds of sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat. The purpose of such transcendental activities is to get free from material entanglement. The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated by the word sat. The performer of such sacrifice is also called sat, as are all works of sacrifice, penance and charity which, true to the absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of Prtha. Anything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme, O son of Prtha, is impermanent. It is called asat and is useless both in this life and the next.

6|Bhisma Parva|Chapter Eighteen|The Perfection of Renunciation|False|"Arjuna said: O mighty-armed one, I wish to understand the purpose of renunciation [tyaga] and of the renounced order of life [sannyasa], O killer of the Kesi demon, master of the senses. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The giving up of activities that are based on material desire is what great learned men call the renounced order of life [sannyasa]. And giving up the results of all activities is what the wise call renunciation [tyaga]. Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given up as faulty, yet other sages maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance should never be abandoned. O best of the Bharatas, now hear My judgment about renunciation. O tiger among men, renunciation is declared in the scriptures to be of three kinds. Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up; they must be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls. All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Prtha. That is My final opinion. Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If one gives up his prescribed duties because of illusion, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance. Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome or out of fear of bodily discomfort is said to have renounced in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation. O Arjuna, when one performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit, his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness. The intelligent renouncer situated in the mode of goodness, neither hateful of inauspicious work nor attached to auspicious work, has no doubts about work. It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities. But he who renounces the fruits of action is called one who has truly renounced. For one who is not renounced, the threefold fruits of action-desirable, undesirable and mixed-accrue after death. But those who are in the renounced order of life have no such result to suffer or enjoy. O mighty-armed Arjuna, according to the Vedanta there are five causes for the accomplishment of all action. Now learn of these from Me. The place of action [the body], the performer, the various senses, the many different kinds of endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul-these are the five factors of action. Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused by these five factors. Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five factors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are. One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled, though he kills men in this world, does not kill. Nor is he bound by his actions. Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are the three factors that motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer are the three constituents of action. According to the three different modes of material nature, there are three kinds of knowledge, action and performer of action. Now hear of them from Me. That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities, though they are divided into innumerable forms, you should understand to be in the mode of goodness. That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion. And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all, without knowledge of the truth, and which is very meager, is said to be in the mode of darkness. That action which is regulated and which is performed without attachment, without love or hatred, and without desire for fruitive results is said to be in the mode of goodness. But action performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify his desires, and enacted from a sense of false ego, is called action in the mode of passion. That action performed in illusion, in disregard of scriptural injunctions, and without concern for future bondage or for violence or distress caused to others is said to be in the mode of ignorance. One who performs his duty without association with the modes of material nature, without false ego, with great determination and enthusiasm, and without wavering in success or failure is said to be a worker in the mode of goodness. The worker who is attached to work and the fruits of work, desiring to enjoy those fruits, and who is greedy, always envious, impure, and moved by joy and sorrow, is said to be in the mode of passion. The worker who is always engaged in work against the injunctions of the scripture, who is materialistic, obstinate, cheating and expert in insulting others, and who is lazy, always morose and procrastinating is said to be a worker in the mode of ignorance. O winner of wealth, now please listen as I tell you in detail of the different kinds of understanding and determination, according to the three modes of material nature. O son of Prtha, that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, is in the mode of goodness. O son of Prtha, that understanding which cannot distinguish between religion and irreligion, between action that should be done and action that should not be done, is in the mode of passion. That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion, under the spell of illusion and darkness, and strives always in the wrong direction, O Partha, is in the mode of ignorance. O son of Prtha, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice, and which thus controls the activities of the mind, life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness. But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion, economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O Arjuna. And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming, fearfulness, lamentation, moroseness and illusion-such unintelligent determination, O son of Prtha, is in the mode of darkness. O best of the Bharatas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he  comes to the end of all distress. That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness. That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion. And that happiness which is blind to self-realization, which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep, laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance. There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, which is freed from these three modes born of material nature. Brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras are distinguished by the qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material modes, O chastiser of the enemy. Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness-these are the natural qualities by which the brahmanas work. Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity and leadership are the natural qualities of work for the ksatriyas. Farming, cow protection and business are the natural work for the vaisyas, and for the sudras there is labor and service to others. By following his qualities of work, every man can become perfect. Now please hear from Me how this can be done. By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, a man can attain perfection through performing his own work. It is better to engage in one's own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another's occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one's nature are never affected by sinful reactions. Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kunti, even if such work is full of fault. One who is self-controlled and unattached and who disregards all material enjoyments can obtain, by practice of renunciation, the highest perfect stage of freedom from reaction. O son of Kunti, learn from Me how one who has achieved this perfection can attain to the supreme perfectional stage, Brahman, the stage of highest knowledge, by acting in the way I shall now summarize. Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little, who controls his body, mind and power of speech, who is always in trance and who is detached, free from false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and acceptance of material things, free from false proprietorship, and peaceful-such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization. One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me. One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God. Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My pure devotee, under My protection, reaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace. In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me. If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost. If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be falsely directed. By your nature, you will have to be engaged in warfare. Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But, compelled by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kunti. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy. O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode. Thus I have explained to you knowledge still more confidential. Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do. Because you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you My supreme instruction, the most confidential knowledge of all. Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit. Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend. Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear. This confidential knowledge may never be explained to those who are not austere, or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me. For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear. And I declare that he who studies this sacred conversation of ours worships Me by his intelligence. And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reactions and attains to the auspicious planets where the pious dwell. O son of Prtha, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your mercy. I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions. Sanjaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, Krishna and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end. By the mercy of Vyasa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, Krishna, who was speaking personally to Arjuna. O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment. O King, as I remember the wonderful form of Lord Krishna, I am struck with wonder more and more, and I rejoice again and again. Wherever there is Krishna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.

Bhima became superhuman and created a scene of terror that caused the enemy's hair to stand on end. From the terrace of his car he rained a shower of arrows upon all warriors in the Kalinga army. The King of the Kalingas, Shrutayus, and his son Sakradeva attacked Bhima and pierced him with their shafts. They managed to kill Bhima's horses, and becoming confident of victory, Sakradeva assaulted Bhima, intending to send him to region of Yamaraja. Bhima countered those weapons with his own, and taking up a huge mace, he released it with tremendous force. That mace scorched through the air, and simultaneously killed the charioteer and Sakradeva. The mace was thrown with such power that no one could distinguish the body of that prince any longer.

The Kalinga army, seeing Bhima single handedly fighting with tens of thousands of men, thought that he was not a human being but a celestial warrior. Rushing at Bhanumat's elephant, Bhima jumped onto his tusk and then onto his back, and with one swing of his sword, he divided Bhanumat in the middle. One half fell off one side of the elephant, and one half fell off the other side. With a thunderous roar, Bhima raised his mighty sword and severed the head of that prince of the elephants, causing it to fall to the ground.

They were armed with maces, darts, javelins, swords, and bows and arrows. They surrounded him and hoped by sheer numbers they could kill him. Bhima, smiling all the while, took up a powerful mace and quickly descended from his chariot. Wheeling his mace around and around, he sent seven hundred warriors to the abode of death, and within a mere twinkling of an eye, he killed another two thousand warriors.

By this time the Kalingas had rallied and attacked the two heroes as they stood in their chariots. Bow in hand, Bhima began to slay the enemy, causing a river of blood to flow from the warriors born in Kalinga. The Kalingas thought that Bhima was Yamaraja himself, and they sent up cries for help. Coming to their aid, Bhishma, the great grandsire of the Kurus, attacked Bhima releasing his steel shafted arrows. Bhima countered those arrows and released an iron dart with all his strength. Seeing that dart coming toward him, Bhishma tore it to pieces. Bhishma quickly killed Bhima's horses, and the son of Pandu, taking up a mace ran on foot towards the great grandsire. However, Dhristadyumna quickly took the mighty Bhima onto his chariot and took him away to safety. To stop Bhishma's advance, Satyaki killed his charioteer, and the grandsire of the Kuru dynasty was borne away by his horses with the speed of the wind. Bhimasena then finished the massacre of the Kalinga army like fire consuming a dry forest.

Releasing his lethal weapons, he severed the arms, legs and heads of the oncoming enemy. So quick did he sever their heads that the trunks remained on the chariots still grasping weapons or armed with bow and arrow.

Gadadhar Pandit actually accompanied Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu a short distance from Jagannatha Puri, and the Lord was not pleased, and ultimately sent him back. On the other hand, Ramanujacharya received a mantra from his guru and took a vow not to tell anyone. However, Ramanuja went to the rooftops and yelled the mantra for everyone to hear. Ultimately, the townspeople became Krishna conscious by the mantra, and Ramanujachary's guru was pleased. One cannot be attached to mundane morality, but to the satisfaction of guru and Krishna.

You are always speaking, O Suta, of the defeat of my army and the victory of the Pandavas. Indeed, O Sanjaya, you are describing my army as cowardly, as being slaughtered, as running from the battlefield. You continually proclaim of the glories of the Pandava army and the weaknesses of my army. Then again, you are constantly pointing out the faults of my son Duryodhana. Tell me, O Sanjaya, the means by which my sons may subjugate their enemy.

As you have said, providence is supreme. Those who are wicked by nature can never be victorious over those who are pious, no matter how many soldiers they may have. Listen now, O monarch, as I narrate the great slaughter of divisions in both armies. When the dawn of the fourth  arrived, Bhishma, surrounded by fearless chariot warriors and supported by millions of troops, attacked the Pandava army with heroic valor. Arjuna, the carrier of the Gandiva bow, came up to challenge Bhishma, and a fierce duel began between those foremost warriors. Meanwhile Ashvatthama, Bhurishrava, Chitrasena, and the son of Sala all attacked Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra. Abhimanyu appeared like a young lion fighting with five elephants. Abhimanyu pierced the son of Drona with one shaft and Salya with five. He cut the standard from the chariot of the son of Sala, and with another arrow, he cut to pieces a mighty dart thrown by Bhurishrava. He then killed the four horses drawing the chariot of Salya. With his powerful arrows, Abhimanyu checked the progress of those great generals. Bhurishravas, Salya, Ashvatthama and Samyamani not being able to challenge Arjuna's son, fled the battlefield.

Taking up a fearsome scimitar and stepping off his chariot, the son of Sala ran at Dhristadyumna intending to chop him to pieces. The Panchala Prince quickly took up a gigantic mace and shattered the head of that heroic warrior. Falling to the ground, Sala's son loosened his grasp on his weapon and gave up his life. Angered and furious at seeing his son slain, Sala, ran towards the prince of the Panchalas who was invincible in combat. A fierce duel then commenced in which neither could overcome the other.

Seeing that elephant army coming forward, causing the earth to tremble, Bhima took up his mace and got down from his chariot. He uttered loud war cries like a lion and rushed at those elephants swinging his deadly weapon. Protecting Bhima from the rear was the son of Subhadra, Nakula, Sahadeva and Dhristadyumna. They countered the arrows released from the elephant warriors. The ruler of Magadha was riding on an elephant that resembled the celestial Airavata. However, Abhimanyu killed that mighty beast with one shaft.

O charioteer, guide my chariot close to where these sinful persons are positioned."" Vishoka then drove the chariot closer to the sons of Dhritarastra. Duryodhana, seeing Bhima approaching, released nine arrows that shattered Bhima's bow. Stringing another bow, Bhima cut the bow of his cousin in two. Duryodhana, however, picked up another bow, and drawing the string back to his ear released an arrow with all his might. That arrow pierced Bhima's chest causing him to fall in a deadly swoon on the terrace of his chariot. Abhimanyu and the Pandava army came forward to safeguard Bhima.

Bhishma, the son of Shantanu, fought fiercely trying to protect Dhritarastra's sons from the weapons of Bhima. All  long the elephants' shrieks, the horses' neighing and the blare of conchshells could be heard in all directions. Fighting for victory's sake, mighty combatants roared at one another like bulls in a cow pen. Heads were seen falling from the bodies of fierce warriors, severed by crescent shaped arrows. An infinite number of heads were lying on the Kurukshetra plain decorated with turbans and earrings. The earth was covered with arms and legs decorated with gold ornaments, silken cloth and blood. The dust raised by the soldiers looked like a cloud in the sky, and the lightning in that cloud was the weapons streaking through the air. The cloud's rain was the blood flowing from the slain warriors that decorated the battlefield. Countless warriors, who were unretreating in battle, lay on the ground blocking the way of the onrushing enemy. So thick was the mass of dead elephants, horses and men, that the battlefield became like a maze. Half dead warriors lay on the ground shrieking in agony, calling out for their kinsmen. Some warriors had only half their head severed and others only had one arm, while others only had one leg. Some soldiers had their stomachs torn out with swords, and some had their chests ripped open with battle axes, while others had their heads smashed into their chests with huge maces. The whole scene became ghastly to behold, but still the combatants fought on.

What pious activities did Harischandra perform that my father did not? My father was the purest of men and never spoke a word of untruth. He was a saint amongst the kingly order. Please tell me why my father is not in the court of Indra.""

The great Harischandra was the son of Trishanku, the favorite of the sage Visvamitra. Harischandra was a powerful monarch and had conquered all the kingdoms of the earth. Because of his pious activities, he was able to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. For this reason he is able to share the same throne with Indra. The king who performs the Rajasuya sacrifice receives immense benefit in the heavenly realm. While I was in Yamaraja's abode, I met your father. He told me, 'My sons have become powerful on earth. If Yudhisthira performs the Rajasuya, I will be transferred to Indraloka, and also his fame will be spread far and wide.' This is the desire of your father. With your four brothers to help you and with Lord Krishna on your side, it will be possible for you to perform the Rajasuya. However, you must first conquer all the earthly kings. It is not an easy task, but I know you are capable of it. Reflecting on this, do as you think fit. I will go to Dvaraka City and request Lord Krishna to help you."" Narada then left Indraprastha and ascended into the heavens, constantly chanting the glories of Lord Krishna.

Before the appearance of Lord Krishna, Bhumi, the superintending deity of this earth, requested relief from the unnecessary military forces which burdened her. The demigods headed by Lord Brahma then went to the ocean of milk to pray to Lord Vishnu. Kshirodakasayi Vishnu answered the prayers of Brahma and appeared as the son of Devaki. Lord Krishna knows past, present and future. He could foresee the battle of Kurukshetra and its outcome. He remembered how in Vaikuntha His two doorkeepers Jaya and Vijaya had been cursed by the four Kumaras to come to this material world. Jaya and Vijaya were to act as enemies of the Lord and allow Him to exhibit His fighting tendency.

The kingdom of God is within all of us, and it has to be awakened by the process of hearing, chanting and remembering the Name, features and activities of the Supreme Godhead. What was available to the Pandavas is available to all of us by hearing the glories of the Lord from the Lord's bonafide representatives and scriptures. Hearing and chanting will lead to absorption in the Lord which will take one beyond this world of birth and death.

The queens were adorned with fine clothing, ornaments, fragrant oils and flower garlands, and they were surrounded on all sides by soldiers carrying swords and shields.

In the Lord's Kingdom there are desire trees from which a person can choose whatever he likes to serve the Lord, chintamani prakara sadmansu kalpa vriksha. (B.S. 5.22) The word kalpa vriksha means desire tree from which one can choose anything that he likes. These trees do not exist in this world.

They were both expert fighters with clubs, and their techniques of striking one another were so beautiful that they appeared to be two dramatic artists dancing on a stage. The citizens of Magadha, consisting of thousands of brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, shudras, women and the aged, all came out of the city to witness the combat. The crowd became so great that there was a solid mass of humanity with no space between bodies.

When two elephants fight together in a sugarcane field, each of them snatches a stick of sugarcane and, by catching it tightly in its trunk, strikes the other. Each elephant heavily strikes his enemy's shoulders, arms, collarbones, chest, thighs, waist, and legs, and in this way the sticks of sugarcane are smashed. Similarly, all the clubs used by Jarasandha and Bhimasena were broken, and so the enemies prepared to fight with their strong-fisted hands. Both Jarasandha and Bhimasena were very angry, and they began to smash each other with their fists. The striking of their fists sounded like the striking of iron bars or like the sound of thunderbolts, and they appeared to be like two elephants fighting. Unfortunately, however, neither was able to defeat the other because both were very expert in fighting, both were of equal strength, and their fighting techniques were equal also. Neither Jarasandha nor Bhimasena became fatigued or defeated in the fighting, although they struck each other continually. At the end of a 's fighting, both lived at night as friends in Jarasandha's palace, and the next  they fought again. In this way they passed twenty-seven s in fighting.

Lord Krishna, however, knew the mystery of the birth of Jarasandha. Jarasandha was born in two different parts from two different mothers. When his father saw that the baby was useless, he threw the two parts in the forest, where they were later found by a black-hearted witch named Jara. She managed to join the two parts of the body of the baby from top to bottom. Knowing this, Lord Krishna, therefore, also knew how to kill him. He gave hints to Bhimasena that since Jarasandha was brought to life by the joining of the two parts of his body, he could be killed by the separation of these two parts. Thus Lord Krishna transferred His power into the body of Bhimasena and informed him of the device by which Jarasandha could be killed. Lord Krishna immediately picked up a twig from a tree and, taking it in His hand, bifurcated it. In this way He hinted to Bhimasena how Jarasandha could be killed. Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is omnipotent, and if he wants to kill someone, no one can save that person. Similarly, if He wants to save someone, no one can kill him.

Catching Jarasandha in this way, he tore his body in two, from the anus up to the head. As an elephant breaks the branches of a tree in two, so Bhimasena separated the body of Jarasandha. The citizens of Magadha who were standing nearby saw that the body of Jarasandha was now divided into two halves, so that each half had one leg, one thigh, one testicle, one breast, half a backbone, half a chest, one collarbone, one arm, one eye, one ear and half a face.

Although Jarasandha was killed, neither Krishna nor the two Pandava brothers made a claim to the throne. Their purpose in killing Jarasandha was to stop him from creating a disturbance against the proper discharge of world peace. A demon always creates disturbances, whereas a godly person always tries to keep peace in the world. The mission of Lord Krishna is to give protection to the righteous persons and to kill the demons who disturb a peaceful situation. Therefore Lord Krishna immediately called for the son of Jarasandha, whose name was Sahadeva, and with due ritualistic ceremonies He asked him to occupy the seat of his father and reign over the kingdom peacefully. Lord Krishna is the master of the whole cosmic creation, and He wants everyone to live peacefully and execute Krishna consciousness. After installing Sahadeva on the throne, He released all the kings and princes who had been imprisoned unnecessarily by Jarasandha.

Thus men naturally forget the real purpose of life: to attain the favor of Lord Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is unfortunate that living beings have to learn the hard way. If we simply by follow the instructions of Lord Krishna, peaceful living automatically follows.

If the people of the world divide the whole society, into four orders for material and spiritual progress, and following the instructions of Krishna as stated in Bhagavad-gita, the entire human society will undoubtedly be happy. Presently people don't know how to be happy. Because, by ignoring the instructions of the Lord and guided by their personal motivations, they have created hell on earth. Five thousand years ago the earth needed a cleansing of evil kings, and so also, to, the earth needs a thorough cleansing of the ungodly.

O Krishna, You are unlimited, and although we  think of ourselves as royal kings and rulers of the world and become puffed up over our paltry positions, we are very poor in heart. Actually, we are fit to be punished by You, but the wonder is that instead of punishing us, You so kindly and mercifully accept our orders and carry them out properly.

Your real position is always exalted, exactly like that of the sun, which always remains at the same temperature both during the time of its rising and the time of its setting. Although we feel the difference in temperature between the rising and the setting sun, the temperature of the sun never changes. You are always transcendentally equipoised, and thus You are neither pleased nor disturbed by any condition of material affairs. You are the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, and for You there are no relativities. My dear Madhava, You are never defeated by anyone. Material distinctions - 'This is me.' 'This is you.' 'This is mine.' 'This is yours.'--are all conspicuous by dint of their absence in You. Such distinctions are visible in the lives of everyone, even the animals, but those who are pure devotees are freed from these false distinctions.

No one has sufficient wealth nor does anyone have complete sovereignty of the world. The demigods will not attend a sacrifice in Kali yuga, and there are no learned brahmanas or priests available; therefore, all such sacrifices are forbidden by the shastras. The only sacrifice recommended in the shastras is the chanting of the Holy Names of God, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare\ Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This simple sacrifice has been enunciated by the incarnation for this age of Kali, Shree Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He is non different from Lord Krishna Himself. The Lord has given this easy process to the fallen people of this age, because no one can perform sacrifices like the Rajasuya or ashvamedha. This easy sacrifice of chanitng the holy names can be performed by anyone; and when the Holy Names are chanted without offense, the Supreme Lord becomes as pleased as when opulent sacrifices were performed in previous ages.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Six|Shishupala's Liberation|True|"We should try to better understand the position of Shishupala. Although Shishupala acted as the enemy of Krishna, he was not for a single moment out of Krishna consciousness. He was always absorbed in thought of Krishna, and thus he got first the salvation of sayujya-mukti, merging into the existence of the Supreme, and finally became reinstated in his original position of personal service. The Bhagavad-gita corroborates the fact that if one is absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Lord at the time of death, he immediately enters the kingdom of God after quitting his material body. The story of the fall of Jaya and Vijaya from the Vaikuntha planets to the material world is described in the Seventh Canto of the Shrimad-Bhagavatam. The killing of Shishupala has a direct link with that narration of jaya and Vijaya, but the most important instruction that we get from this incident is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being absolute, can give salvation to everyone, whether one acts as His enemy or as His friend. It is, therefore, a misconception that the Lord acts with someone in the relationship of a friend and with someone else in the relationship of an enemy. His being an enemy or friend is always on the absolute platform. There is no material distinction.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Six|Shishupala's Liberation|True|"Another point to be found in this chapter is that Shishupala's blasphemy of Lord Krishna was actually glorification. Shishupala made the statement that Lord Krishna does not belong to any caste. Actually, Krishna does not belong to any caste, nor does He have to perform any occupational duty. It is stated in the Vedas that the Supreme Lord has nothing to do as His prescribed duty. Whatever has to be done on His behalf is executed by His different energies. He is transcendental to the caste system. Indeed, he is the cause of the Varnashrama system as stated in Bhagavad-gita, ""The four orders of occupation were created by Me according to quality and work."" (B.g. 3.14) Since Krishna is the creator of this system, He is not subject to it. Therefore, Shishupala was correct when he said, ""We do not know to what caste this Krishna belongs.""

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Six|Shishupala's Liberation|True|"Shishupala was also correct when he said that Krishna was not a king of this world. Krishna is much greater than a worldly king. He is the Supreme Godhead. There is no need for Him to become a worldly king in order to show His divinity. His kingdom is not of this world, but of the kingdom of God. The president of the United States very rarely visits a prison, although he controls it, because of the rebelliousness of the inmates. The Supreme Lord is very kind in that He  visits this world to encourage the living beings to come back to the kingdom of God.

The different parts of their beautiful bodies, particularly their breasts and waists, became partially visible because of the wet cloth. The queens also brought in buckets of liquid substances and sprinkled them on the bodies of their husbands. As they engaged in such jubilant activities, their hair fell loose, and the flowers decorating their bodies began to fall. When Lord Krishna, Arjuna and the queens were thus engaged in these jubilant activities, persons who were not clean in heart became agitated by lustful desires. Such behavior between pure males and females is enjoyable, but persons who are materially contaminated become lustful.

Since one cannot treat one part of his body differently from another part because they all belong to the same body, so a Vaishnava does not see a human being as distinct from an animal because in both of them he sees the soul and the Supersoul seated simultaneously.

He who becomes envious of anothers' wealth suffers the pangs of death. Yudhisthira does not know about deception, and therefore, always treats you as a friend. If he is not jealous of you, why should you be jealous of him? One who covets the possessions of others is never remembered in the records of history, but on other hand, one who strives to acquire his own wealth by honest means attains lasting fame. I look on both of you as my own sons, therefore give up this jealousy.""

At that time Bhima laughed at me, and anger sprung up in my heart; and if Krishna had not been there, I would have slain Vrikodara. It is natural to have enemies and friends. They have been chosen by providence. The Pandavas are my determined enemies, and I will destroy them. I will not be content until I have accomplished this, O Bharata; do not let the opulence of the enemy increase. If you consult with Vidura, he will advise you to desist.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Eight|The Evil Plan|True|"Duryodhana could not be satisfied even with the immense wealth of his father. This is the nature of materialistic persons. The heart burns with lust and greed, and they are never satisfied. Duryodhana thought Yudhisthira to be his enemy, but the actual enemy was in his heart. In the third chapter of Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna told Arjuna, ""It is lust only, Arjuna, born out of the mode of passion, and later transformed into wrath, which is the all devouring sinful enemy of this world."" (B.g. 3.37) Lusty desires can never be satisfied. Once one desire is fulfilled, another arises like a blazing fire. These desires whip the living being and don't allow him to be content. Only when this enemy is defeated within can there be real peace.

This process will stop the blazing fire of lust within the heart and conquer the real foe. Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has given us this sublime process to stop the repetition of birth and death. He has requested everyone to chant the Maha-mantra, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The translation of this is, ""O energy of the Lord, O my Lord, please engage me in Thy loving service."" Lord Chaitanya left no hard and fast rules on which name of God you may chant for the Lord has hundreds and thousands of names. However, everyone He met He requested them to chant the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, for this great mantra would deliver everyone in the age. The important point is to chant the holy name dear to you and conquer the enemy within.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Eight|The Evil Plan|True|"At present nations are forming peace conferences to pacify the waring factions of the world, but until there is internal peace, there can be no external peace. In the name of God and religion, people perform greedy and lusty acts, because they have not subdued the real enemy within--lust and greed. Duryodhana could never be contented as long as he could not recognize his real enemy. Yudhisthira had conquered this enemy, and because he was at peace within, he was at peace without. His name is Ajatrashatru, one whose enemy was never born. That means that he never saw anyone as an enemy, even though others looked at him differently. His heart was completely situated on the transcendental platform of love for God.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Eight|The Evil Plan|True|"When Vidura heard the evil plan to steal the wealth of the Pandavas, he knew the age of Kali had arrived. Kali Yuga means the age of quarrel and hypocrisy. Before the age of Kali, kings were rajarshis, godly men in the dress of kings. Duryodhana was the first king to exhibit the qualities of Kali Yuga: envy, lust, greed, anger, etc. Therefore, Vidura, due to his vast knowledge and realization, could immediately understand that the age of Kali was here because Duryodhana envied the godly and pious Pandavas. Although Kali Yuga is an iron age of bad qualities, where the people are sunk in ignorance, still there is great mercy in this age. Just by chanting the Holy Names of God, one can stop the repetition of birth and death and go back to the kingdom of God.

Following them were Duryodhana and his one hundred brothers, Shakuni and the other members of the Kuru race such as Bhishma, Somadatta and Bhurishravas. The Pandavas were shown the assembly hall, and out of courtesy the Pandavas expressed appreciation for the beauty of the royal assembly court.

Do you remember the time when this son of yours was born and brayed like a jackal. A jackal is living in your house in the form of Duryodhana. He will bring about the destruction of the Bharata race. At the time of his birth, I told you to cast him aside and save the Kuru dynasty, but you did not take my advice, and now you will have to pay heavily. This injustice in the form of a gambling match will not go unpunished. You will suffer greatly in old age because of the deaths of your sons at the hands of the Pandavas. Gambling is the foundation of all sin, and leads one to hellish life. Your son does not have the strength to fight with the Pandavas in a manly war. He is cheating them with the help of this prince of the cheaters. Please do not allow gambling match to continue, or it will have gruesome results. I urgently request you to stop this game.""

The wise have said that there is no greater vice than to injure one's master. Why do you not fear this sin? We are now prevailing over our enemies, and we have now acquired great riches.

Your son, O King, is dishonest, and his actions are proving it. If you allow impious actions to continue, you will have to reap the impious repercussions that will come in the future. We have never seen in the history of the world honest kings acting like your son. On the contrary, only the most vindictive of wicked kings act in the way Duryodhana is acting.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Nine|The Gambling Match|True|"Those who are demoniac by nature are always envious of those who are godly. The Pandavas were great devotees of the Lord and possessed divine qualities. They appeared to be temporarily defeated in the wicked gambling match arranged by the sinful son of Dhritarastra. Because the cause of the Pandavas was just and because they were always taking shelter of Lord Krishna, they were destined to have their wealth returned and the offenders were to be punished. As stated in the final verse of Bhagavad-gita, ""Wherever there is Krishna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion."" (B.g. 18.78) In summary, one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord can never be vanquished in his struggle for existence in this material world.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Nine|The Gambling Match|True|"As stated by Vidura, gambling is the root of all evil. There are four pillars of sinful life: illicit sex, gambling, meat eating and intoxication. When living beings take shelter of these four sinful activities, they are under the influence of Kali yuga. At the time of Maharaja Yudhisthira, there was no adultery, no gambling casinos, no slaughter houses and no LSD, cocaine, crack, whiskey, beer or other forms of intoxication. These types of sinful activities are indulged in by persons in the modes of passion and ignorance, but were unknown in Maharaja Yudhisthira's kingdom.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Nine|The Gambling Match|True|"When Vidura heard of the plan for the gambling match, he knew that Kali yuga had begun. This type of cheating was just unheard of amongst the royal order. Before the age of Kali, the monarchial regimes were anxious to be known in the history books for their morality and honesty. Dishonest rulers were marked down and cursed. The only reason this sinister gambling match didn't succeed was because of the presence of Lord Krishna on Earth. However, the  Lord Krishna left this world, Kali began his nefarious work with full force. We are only 5,000 years into the Kali yuga and already the four sinful pillars are taken for granted and are in full swing. No one is shocked by them. Practically every corner has a bar; adultry is no longer looked upon as sinful; 99% of the population eats meat; and a vast majority of people drink intoxicating beverages. Vidura told Dhritarastra that there would be a heavy reaction to cheating at dice. However, Dhritarastra was blind to what was right and what was wrong. Similarly, saintly persons have repeatedly warned human society of the reactions to sinful life. Nonetheless, people do not listen. When there are earthquakes, world wars, incurable diseases, famine, floods, depressions, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disturbances, people cannot understand that these are reactions to sinful life. However, human beings are too absorbed in sinful life to want to renounce it and be happy. Sinful life and their concomitment reactions are destined to increase as the Kali yuga progresses.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Ten|Lord Krishna Protects Draupada|True|"Offences against devotees never go unpunished. When one offends great souls, one loses his opulence, life span and family, and he suffers greatly. The seed of the offense was planted during the gambling match. That seed later sprouted and bore its fruit on the Kurukshetra plain. Duryodhana lost everything because of his hatred for the Pandavas. All actions bear their fruit in due course. As stated in all scriptures, ""Pride cometh before a fall."" Duryodhana was full of false pride and not fit to rule. His downfall was only a matter of time.

Actually, God has nothing to do with it. The Supreme Lord sends the holy scriptures and holy people to request everyone to follow His law. If people do not follow His law, they must suffer. The living being creates his own happiness and distress. God has stated, ""Thou shalt not kill."" Still people open slaughter houses and kill innocent animals. Jesus Christ opened the cages of the doves and lambs, and turned over the tables of the money changers declaring, ""My father's house shall not be made a den of thieves."" If he didn't allow animals to be sacrificed before God, then surely a slaughter house would be condemned. We have to learn to take seriously what the Lord wants of us. If we don't then we have to suffer.

2|Sabha Parva|Chapter Ten|Lord Krishna Protects Draupada|True|"One may rightly ask why Bhishma and Drona did not defend the Pandavas while the offenses were being committed. Bhishma could have stopped the whole affair at that moment. He could have killed Duryodhana and anyone else who opposed religiosity. For his failure to defend the Pandavas, he had to die during the Kurukshetra war. Was it because he was dependent on Duryodhana that he didn't speak out? No, the answer is that it was actually the Lord's desire. Many purposes were served by this one incident. One, Krishna wanted to show Draupadi and the world that He is the only shelter. If Bhishma had spoken out, then Draupadi could not have realized this, but would have become dependent on Bhishma instead of Lord Krishna. Secondly, because Bhishma ultimately chose the side of Duryodhana, Lord Krishna wanted to show the world that if even you are the greatest warrior in the world, if you oppose religious principles, you are destined to die.

He was a pure devotee of the Lord. However, he felt the situation to be the desire of the Lord for a higher purpose. Pure devotees know the will of the Lord and act accordingly in all circumstances. He could have challenged Duryodhana to battle or he could have just refused to gamble with Shakuni. These things all seem the logical thing to do. However, Lord Krishna is not under the law of logic. We cannot figure out His divine plan. We can only submit to His divine will. No one will argue that the Pandavas or Bhishma were not pure devotees. Bhishma is one of the twelve mahajanas or authorities on devotional service. That is a rarely attained position. Therefore, it is concluded that Bhishma was bewildered by Lord Krishna's internal potency so that he could not take action to defend the Pandavas.

He spent his s and nights in anxiety thinking about the  when the Pandavas would return from the forest. When he turned his back on the ways of righteousness, he came face to face with anxiety and grief. Those who are attached to material possessions can never be happy. Here we see that although Dhritarastra was the king of the world, he was not content. He was worried that some  the Pandavas would come back from the forest and take his wealth and kill his sons. This is the nature of material attachment; it can never bring peace.

Fruitive workers desire material enjoyment, jnanis desire liberation, and yogis desire material opulence; therefore, they are all lusty and cannot be peaceful."" Although the Pandavas were robbed of their wealth and had to reside in the forest for so many years, still they were quite happy because they had the association of Lord Krishna. They accepted Him as their friend, guide, spiritual master, and their only protector. They did not desire an opulent kingdom or great riches. They were perfectly satisfied in their friendship with the Supreme Lord Krishna. Thus the forest became like the spiritual world, and the court in Hastinapura became like a hellish planet because of offences committed against the pure devotees of the Lord.

We come into this world with nothing, and we leave with nothing. Material possessions, if not used in the service of the Lord, simply are a source of anxiety. We constantly worry about who is going to take our material possessions. A rich person must constantly worry about the motivations of persons who try to become his friends. Real peace must be found by cleansing the heart. Lord Krishna tells Arjuna, ""One whose happiness is within, who is active within, who rejoices within and is illumined within, is actually the perfect mystic. he is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme."" (B.g. 5.24) In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means to attain peace is to chant the Holy Names of God, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Because Dhritarastra tried to find peace in material wealth, friends and family, he was in constant anxiety.

The son of Bhima, Sutasoma, pierced Ashvatthama with a lance, and then ran at him with a sword. The wicked Ashvatthama cut off Sutasoma's arm and then struck him in the side depriving him of life. The valiant Satanika, the son of Nakula, took up a chariot wheel and struck Drona's son. Not minding the force of the weapon, the preceptor's son cut of the head of that great warrior. The son of Sahadeva, Srutakarman, then attacked Ashvatthama with a spiked bludgeon. However, Ashvatthama struck him in the face with his sword, and that heroic prince fell down dead. Srutakirti, the son of Arjuna, then showered arrows upon the sinful son of Drona. Countering those arrows with his sword, Ashvatthama cut off the head of Arjuna's son.

Filled with anger, Drona's son severed his body in two. There were thousands upon thousands of warriors left in that camp, and they all awoke in a state of confusion. As they came out of their tents, they were slaughtered by Ashvatthama. The son of Drona set the camp on fire in three places causing greater confusion. The elephants bolted in fear and began trampling servants, soldiers and tents in their attempt to escape from the camp. Some warriors who were bewildered, slew each other in the confusion. Ashvatthama then ascended his chariot and began to slaughter all who approached him. He severed the heads, arms, and legs of the Panchalas, the Somakas, and the Shrinjayas. Anyone who attempted to escape were killed by Kripacharya and Kritavarman, who had now developed the same mentality of Ashvatthama. Stationed at the gates of the camp, they killed all who endeavored to leave. By the time the morning had arrived, the Pandava camp was again quiet. The remnant of the Pandava army had now been slain. Thousands upon thousands of men, servants, elephants, and horses lay in pools of blood, silenced by the weapons of the merciless son of Drona. The Rakshasas had already appeared in the camp attracted by the stench of blood and flesh. They devoured human bodies one after another in great happiness.

With great effort, they revived him, and Ashvatthama, wanting to please him before his death, told Duryodhana that he had beheaded the Pandavas and brought their heads as a gift. When Duryodhana felt the heads, he could understand that they were the Pandava's sons and not the Pandavas.

When I informed my father of this, he went to the Vasus and asked that the curse be removed. The Vasus replied to him, Arjuna has a powerful son who is the ruler of Manipur. In battle his son will slay him. At that time Arjuna will be freed from this curse.' I have acted in the way I did to free you from this curse. Please do not be angry with me.

They were being followed by many pious citizens who could not bear separation from those saintly kings. The citizens of Hastinapura did not want to live in a kingdom where Duryodhana and his followers ruled. They thus petitioned the Pandavas, ""All blessings upon the sons of Pandu! Where will you now go, leaving us in grief? We are distressed learning that your kingdom has deceitfully been taken away by the conniving Duryodhana. It behooves you not to forsake us, because we are your loving subjects. Deterioration of good qualities will certainly manifest by living in the kingdom of the Kuru king, Duryodhana. Please listen as we describe the merits and demerits from association with what is good and what is bad. As cloth, water, earth, and sesame seeds are scented by association with llowers, similarly we are endowed with good qualities as a product of your association. Association with fools produces an illusion that entangles the mind; but daily communion with the pious and wise leads one toward the path of liberation. Therefore, those that desire emancipation should associate with those who are devoted to God, and are wise, honest, pure in conduct and prone toward asceticism. Those persons should be served whose knowledge and actions are all pure, and this association is superior to study of the scriptures. Devoid of religious acts as we are, we shall gain religious merit by association with the righteous, just as one would engage in sin by associating with the sinful. The very sight, touch, association, or conversation with the dishonest causes one to lose purity of mind. Association with base persons impairs spiritual growth, whereas association with self realized souls exalts it. Those attributes found in the Vedas pertaining to religious qualities and extolled by the wise exist simultaneously in you. O sons of Pandu, because we desire our own welfare, and because you possess all exalted qualities, we wish to live with you in the forest.""

The Rakshasa also uprooted a tree and approached Bhima, swinging it with all his might. It appeared like the mace of Yamaraja, but had no effect on Bhima. Bhima and the Rakshasa uprooted all the trees in that area with the intent of killing each other. When neither of those mighty armed heroes could defeat the other with trees, Kirmira tore up a huge boulder and flung it at Bhima. The boulder, however, bounced off Bhima's head, not harming him in the least. The Rakshasa then rushed at Bhima with his outstretched arms, intending to crush him to death. Bhima and the Rakshasa wrestled one another and struck one another with their fists that were as strong as thunderbolts. Remembering his hatred for Duryodhana and looking for some way to release that anger, Bhima seized the Rakshasa with his robust arms, throwing him on the ground with great ferocity. He then grabbed him by the waist and began to whirl him around till he became senseless. Lifting Kirmira up, he bounced him off the ground. The Rakshasa had become weak, and Bhima, grabbing him by the arms, squeezed him with all his strength.

At the time of Lord Rama's exile the citizens of Ayodhya also accompanied Lord Ramachandra to the forest unable to bear the separation of that great king.

Of the two, following the instructions of the spiritual master is the most important, for by this process, one will come to realize the personal presence of the spiritual master. The citizens of Hastinapura were right in following King Yudhisthira's order to return to Hastinapura and give solace to Kuru elders.

3|Vana Parva|Chapter One|The First s of Exile|True|"When Lord Chaitanya was traveling through south India, he met the Kurma brahmana. This brahmana was a householder who came to love Lord Chaitanya very much. In fact when the Lord left his village, he wanted to renounce everything and follow the Lord. However, the Lord instructed him, ""Whoever you meet and whoever you see, instruct them in the message of Bhagavad-gita and Shrimad-Bhagavatam. In this way you will always have my association."" (C.C. Madhya lila) Lord Chaitanya gave this same instruction to all those whom He met on His South Indian tour. Personal association is not as important as following the instructions of the spiritual master.

3|Vana Parva|Chapter One|The First s of Exile|True|"The Pandavas were always under the protection of Lord Krishna. They were blessed whether they were in the forest or their opulent kingdom. A devotee can live anywhere and always think of Krishna. When a devotee always keeps the Lord in his heart, he can turn hell into heaven. A devotee of the Lord is actually a holy place personified, because he has realized the presence of the Lord in his heart and in the heart of all living beings. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, ""The yogi who knows that I and the Supersoul in all creatures are one worships Me and remains always within me in all circumstances."" (B.g. 6.31)

3|Vana Parva|Chapter One|The First s of Exile|True|"The cause of Duryodhana was doomed. Just as one receives the seed of devotion and it fructifies into love of God in due course, so also one can plant the seed of offenses and sins; and in due course the seed will fructify and produce the sour fruits of suffering, misfortune and misery. Duryodhana had planted the seed offenses already by trying to poison Bhima, by trying to burn the Pandavas in a house of lac, by stealing away their kingdom, and by offending Draupadi. He kept watering the original seed of sin by more offenses. In this chapter Duryodhana has offended Maitreya Rishi, for which act Duryodhana is cursed by the Rishi to die by Bhima's mace. He has also displeased Shrila Vyasadeva and been labeled a fool. In a previous chapter Narada also cursed the cause of Duryodhana. Although it appears that Duryodhana has won sovereignty of the whole world, his plant of sin will soon fructify into the fruits of suffering when he faces the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra war.

It was more like a flying city than an airplane, and it could fly so high and at such a great speed that no one could see where it was. When Shalva had acquired this airplane, he decided to attack Dvaraka. When the demon heard of the death of his friend Shishupala at the Rajasuya sacrifice, he was overpowered with resentment. He organized his divisions and attacked Dvaraka City. Not only did he attack Dvaraka from the air, but he also laid siege to My city from the ground with numerous troops.

3|Vana Parva|Chapter Two|Lord Krishna Visits the Pandavas|True|"Lord Krishna loved the Pandavas so much that He  lived with them in the forest. The Pandavas did not request Lord Krishna to relieve their suffering condition. Yudhisthira accepted the loss of his kingdom as destiny and did not complain to Lord Krishna. He could have requested Lord Krishna to fight with Duryodhana and gain back his kingdom, but he didn't. A devotee can accept any condition as the mercy of the Lord. The Pandavas are pure devotees and eternal associates of the Lord; so one may ask why the Lord put them in that condition of life? He did so to show the conditioned souls in this world how to act in times of calamity. By setting the proper example common persons will know how to act. Everyone in this world has been transmigrating through many species of life. In the human form we have committed many sinful activities for which we have to suffer. When a conditioned soul comes to Krishna, the Lord takes his karma and minimizes it. The devotee only receives a token reaction for his past sins and that is given directly by the Lord. Therefore, a devotee should not complain, but thank the Lord for giving a small punishment.

In this chapter Lord Krishna told Arjuna, ""You are Mine, and I am yours....He who hates you, also hates Me, and he who follows you, also follows Me."" With this loving reciprocation, there was no chance for Duryodhana to be victorious. Duryodhana could have had a hundred or a thousand Bhishma's on his side; still he would have lost. When Lord Krishna agrees to protect someone, nothing can harm that person. If Lord Krishna does not protect someone, no one can save that person. Because Bhishma did not take the side of the Pandavas, he was destined to die because he did not receive the protection of Lord Krishna.

It was there that he decided to perform austerities and worship Lord Shiva. In the beginning of his austerities, he ate withered leaves that fell from the trees. For the first month he also ate fruits every three s. In the second month he ate fruits every sixth  and in the third month every fortnight. When the fourth month came, that best of the Bharatas began to subsist on air alone. With his arms upraised and standing on his tiptoes, he continued his austerities. The illustrious hero's matted locks took on the color of lightning due to his severe austerities. Then all the rishis, suffering from the heat of Arjuna's tapasya, went to Lord Shiva and complained, ""O god of gods, we do not know the reason why the son of Kunti is performing these severe austerities.

He related all messages from Indra and Arjuna. He advised them not to worry about Arjuna, since he was under Indra's care in the heavenly realm. He told them how Arjuna was faring, and how he had obtained all the celestial weapons from Lord Shiva, Indra, Kuvera and Varuna. He told Yudhisthira that after Arjuna had finished his business in the heavenly planets, Indra would return him to their association. Lomasa informed the Pandavas of Indra's desire that they should go on pilgrimage and perform austerities. Lomasa instructed Yudhisthira about the necessity for austerity, because that allows one to fulfill ones desires. He then offered to guide them to all the holy spots. Agreeing with the proposals, the Pandavas began their travels and visited all the important holy tirthas in Bharatavarsha.

He performed ablutions for many s and nights and surrounded himself with fire. Thus that greatest of all virtuous men engaged himself in asceticism. While he was practicing these needed austerities, news reached Lord Krishna and Balarama that Yudhisthira was nearby. Those two leaders of the Vrishni race, accompanied by their troops, came to see Yudhisthira. When the Vrishnis beheld the sons of Pandu in ascetic dress, their bodies smeared with dirt, due to lying on the ground, they were beside themselves with grief. They could not refrain themselves from lamentation. When Yudhisthira saw the arrival of the Vrishnis, he paid them honor as far as his means would allow. That pious king, whose determination was so great that no misfortune could cast him down, was overjoyed to see Lord Krishna and Balarama. At the request of the Vrishnis, King Yudhisthira recounted the mischievous acts of the Kurus during the vicious gambling match. He also told them of their adventures in forest life and how Arjuna had gone to the heavenly planets. When the Vrishnis saw the Pandavas so exceedingly lean, they could not check their tears, which spontaneously flowed from their eyes.

We should perform austerities to conform to the will of the Lord. The Lord's desire was that the demoniac kings be replaced with godly kings so that the earth's great burden would be lifted. One may think that Arjuna performed his austerities for some mere weapons. One may think, ""What does that have to do with pure devotional service?"" His desire to obtain the celestial weapons was a part of the Lord's plan to annihilate the miscreants. Therefore, it was pure devotional service.

When Lord Krishna stopped the cowherd men from worshipping Indra, He did so to establish firm monotheism. There is only one God. There was no need to worship Indra. Therefore, why did Arjuna perform austerities to worship Lord Shiva? The answer is that for the service of the Lord, a devotee may worship a demigod. Just like the Gopis of Vrindavana worshiped the Goddess Durga to have Lord Krishna as their husband. They weren't interested in becoming more devoted to the Goddess Durga. Their only interest was Lord Krishna. Similarly, Arjuna's only interest is Krishna and his service to Krishna. What is Arjuna's devotional service? His service is to be an instrument of the Lord in decreasing the burden of the earth. To help in that devotional service, he has worshiped Lord Shiva, Indra, Varuna, Kuvera and Yamaraja. In the Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krishna tells Arjuna, ""In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to establish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.""

When Draupadi saw the flowers, she solicited Bhima, ""There are many Rakshasas living on this mountain, O best of the Bharata race. You possess great prowess and the might of your arms is irrepressible. O Bhimasena, perhaps these Rakshasas, terrified by your powerful mace, will leave this mountain, allowing us to behold the summit which is covered with these beautiful blossoms. O Bhima, for a long time I have cherished this thought in my mind.""

Taking up his weapons, the club, sword, bow and arrow, Bhima proceeded to clear the mountain of Rakshasas, who happened to be the servants of Kuvera and who guarded the mountain from unwanted intruders. Bhima found a rugged path that only one person could follow. Bhima ascended to the summit and came upon the opulent abode of Kuvera, adorned with golden crystal palaces, surrounded on all sides by golden walls embedded with gems. Gardens filled with flowers were everywhere. The abode was graced with heavenly damsels who were expert at dancing. Casually supporting himself on the end of his bow, Bhima stood beholding the city of Kuvera. The foremost of the Bharatas surveyed the Palace of Kuvera adorned with multi-colored gems. Bhima then blew his conchshell making the hair on the Rakshasas' bodies stand on end. Taking up their weapons, the Yakshas and Rakshasas rushed at Bhima, ordering him not proceed further. The Yakshas and Rakshasas released javelins, darts, arrows, maces, and axes at the powerful son of Pandu. However, Bhima crushed their weapons with his own and then began severing their hands, legs, arms and heads. The Rakshasas tried to surround Bhima like the clouds surround the sun. However, just as the sun disperses clouds, so also Bhima repulsed the oncoming enemy. Terrified at this wielder of weapons, they fled in different directions. Only Maniman, the friend of Kuvera, stood to face Bhima with darts and maces in his hand. He addressed the retreating Rakshasas, ""When you go to Kuvera's abode, what will you say to him? That you have been defeated in combat by a mere mortal."" Having scorned them, he took up his weapons and rushed at Bhima to kill him. As he rushed toward Bhima like a maddened elephant, Bhima pierced him with three arrows. The mighty Maniman then released his mace with full force. However, Bhima repulsed the mace with his weapons causing a sound and sight like thunder and lightning. In the meantime, the intelligent Rakshasa discharged an frightening iron club, decorated with a golden handle. The club, belching forth flames and emitting tremendous roars, all of a sudden hit Bhima's right arm and then fell to the ground. On being severely wounded, Bhima, with immeasurable prowess, took up his own mace. He then darted speedily toward the mighty Maniman. Maniman took up a huge dart and released it at Bhima to kill him. However, Bhima broke the dart with the end of his mace. The mighty armed Bhima then sprang into the air releasing his mace as Indra releases a thunderbolt. That mace pulverized the mighty Maniman, who fell to the ground, completely devoid of life. The remaining Rakshasas then fled to save their lives.

In this case Duryodhana got an immediate reaction for his folly. The reaction to the sins at the gambling match took a longer time to fructify. However, all reactions good or bad have their time of maturation. At the battle of the Bharatas at Kurukshetra, Duryodhana would eat the bitter fruit of his sinful activities by watching his entire dynasty destroyed in war. Every action is like a boomerang which comes back to us. As the modern  saying goes, ""What goes around, comes around."" If we want to avoid all material reactions, either good or bad, one must engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Such action produces no material reaction, but produces a spiritual body in the kingdom of God, where there is no influence of the law of karma.

This freedom of envy is a quality of the residents of Vaikuntha. The sanskrit word kuntha means anxiety, but the word vaikuntha means freedom from anxiety and envy. If we want to return to the kingdom of God, we must develop the same quality of being non envious. Even if someone wishes to do us some harm, we should follow the guidelines taught to us by Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, trinad api sunichena, taror api sahisnuna, amanina amanadena, kirtaniya sada hari. ""One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than a blade of grass, more tolerant than a tree, completely devoid of all prestige and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind, one can chant the holy name constantly.""

He told Duhshasana to return to Hastinapura and rule the kingdom. Duhshasana, Karna and Shakuni tried to convince him otherwise, but they failed to do so. Duryodhana spread Kusha grass on the ground and put on the dress of an ascetic. While he was in deep meditation, the Danavas and Daityas witnessed his activities from the heavens. They wanted to stop his act of fasting until death. Thus they ordered that he be brought to their presence. The demons told Duryodhana that he should not give up his life. They told him that many asuras had taken birth on earth to assist him in killing the Pandavas. The demons informed Duryodhana of who he was in his previous life. They said that he had taken birth as the son of Lord Shiva and Parvati, and thus his birth was celestial. He was also informed that Karna was a demon in his previous life and was killed by Lord Krishna, Himself. They said, ""He will remember his former hatred for Krishna and Arjuna and vanquish them in battle."" After speaking to Duryodhana, they returned him to his place of meditation. He awoke as if from a dream and thought, ""Now I will fight with the Pandavas and kill them."" Thus he went back to Hastinapura along with Karna, Shakuni and Duhshasana and thought nothing of his humiliation.

However, the brahmanas told him that as long as his father and Yudhisthira were still alive, he could not perform this sacrifice. They informed him of another sacrifice that was almost equal to the Rajasuya and required the subordination of all the kings of the earth. Duryodhana sent Karna to conquer all the earthly kings, and Radha's son accomplished this feat for his friend. The sacrifice was then started and completed with success. Some who also attended the Rajasuya said it did not compare with Yudhisthira's, and others who were friends with Duryodhana said that it was greater than Yudhisthira's. Hearing this praise from his close friends, Duryodhana resided happily in his kingdom.

As usual, Duryodhana was thinking of doing some harm to the Pandavas. He thought, ""If I can satisfy this muni, then he will give me a benediction that I can use against the Pandavas."" He thus pleased the muni by his service attitude, and the Muni granted him a benediction. Duryodhana asked that the muni go to the forest along with his 60,000 disciples at the time when Draupadi had already taken her meals. Duryodhana was thinking that the Pandavas would not be able to feed the brahmanas, and Durvasa would then curse them. The muni agreed and went to the Kamyaka forest accompanied by his 60,000 disciples. Yudhisthira greeted them and asked that before eating, they bathe in the Ganges. Yudhisthira asked Draupadi if there were any food left in the pot, and she replied that she had already eaten. She then began to pray to Lord Krishna to save them. At that time Lord Krishna appeared on the scene and asked Draupadi if there was any food left in the pot. She said that there was none. Lord Krishna then went to the kitchen, looked in the pot and saw that there was one grain of food left. He ate that grain, and as soon as He did all the 60,000 brahmanas, who were bathing, felt their stomachs so full of food that they had no appetite to eat anything. They were too embarrassed to return to Yudhisthira for full meals. Thus they went away from that place and by the grace of Lord Krishna, the Pandavas were saved from the curse of a great muni.

In the cottage he saw Draupadi, who appeared to be a demigoddess. He was infatuated with love and asked one of his soldiers to inquire about her. The prince went to Draupadi and asked her who her husband was. She told him that she was the wife of the Pandavas, and the prince took the news back to King Jayadratha. The sinful Jayadratha, desiring Draupadi for his wife, approached her and ordered, ""You must now give up the Pandavas for they are no more than beggars. I possess an opulent kingdom, and I can give you the treatment you deserve."" Draupadi laughed at him, but he grabbed her forcefully and took her to his chariot. Dhaumya chastised Jayadratha with harsh words, but the King would not listen. He put her on his chariot and rode toward his kingdom. Dhaumya followed, pleading with Jayadratha to desist from such a heinous act. Meanwhile, the Pandavas noticed some evil omens and came back to the cottage only to find Draupadi and Dhaumya gone and the maidservant crying. The maidservant told Yudhisthira that King Jayadratha had forcibly taken away Draupadi and that Dhaumya had followed them. The five sons of Pandu were furious, and ascending their chariots, they followed the path taken by Jayadratha. They challenged Jayadratha's army and within a short time thousands of men were slain, including some of Jayadratha's finest princes. Jayadratha, seeing the slaughter, left Draupadi and ran for his life. Bhima and Arjuna pursued him and killed his horses. Jayadratha jumped from his chariot and ran into the forest. Bhima caught him by the hair and threw him to the ground. He repeatedly beat him with his fists till he was unconscious. Arjuna asked that Bhima not kill him, for Yudhisthira would not approve of it. Bhima took out a sharpened arrow and cut off his hair, leaving five tufts in different places on his head. He then told Jayadratha that if he wanted to live he would have to announce that he was a slave to King Yudhisthira. Out of fear Jayadratha agreed, and he was taken in chains to the presence of Ajatrashatru. He was made to say that he was a slave to Yudhisthira, and Yudhisthira; feeling compassion for him, ordered his release.

As long as Karna possessed this kundala and kavacha, he could not be killed. Karna offered the brahmana his kingdom instead of his natural armor and earrings, but the brahmana would not be satisfied. Previously, the Sun god had come to Karna warning him that Indra would come in the dress of a brahmana and beg from him his natural armor and earrings. He told his son that he should not part with his armor if he wanted to be successful in killing Arjuna. Karna wanted to be famous as a giver of charity and said he could not refuse any brahmana who came begging something from him. Although Karna knew the brahmana to be Indra, he did not hesitate to give his natural armor and earrings. However, in return he asked for Indra's shakti weapon by which he could kill any opponent in battle. Indra agreed, and Karna received from the heavenly king his shakti weapon. Karna then pealed off his armor which was a part of his body and also cut off his earrings; both were dripping with blood. Indra then returned to his abode, and when the sons of Dhritarastra learned of this incident, they lamented greatly. When the Pandavas headed by Yudhisthira were made aware of this incident, they felt that Arjuna could now kill Karna in battle.

3|Vana Parva|Chapter Six|The Last Year of Forest Life|True|"This chapter contains another example of how the Pandavas were saved by the mercy of Lord Krishna. Durvasa Muni had come with the intention of cursing the Pandavas, which would have surely put impediments on their already difficult life in the forest. Draupadi simply thought of the Lord with intense remembrance and the Lord came there personally to save them. When Lord Krishna ate a morsel of food from Draupadi's pot, the bellies of Durvasa Muni and his 60,000 disciples filled up so much so that they could not return to Yudhisthira for a meal. What was available to Draupadi is available to by intense remembrance of the transcendental form of the Lord. Lord Krishna will always give us protection if we simply remember Him. Although He may not manifest His form to us, He is always present within our hearts, and by our remembering Him, He carries what we are lacking. This is one of the great advantages of deity worship. By practice of sadana bhakti, we see the form of Lord Krishna every morning, and this gradually awakens constant remembrance of the Lord, which will intensify during times of distress. The more we remember Lord Krishna, the more our cycle of birth and death comes to an end.

Having embraced Yudhisthira and spoken words of comfort for the loss of his sons, the blind King sought to embrace Bhima. Knowing the intentions of Dhritarastra, Lord Krishna took Bhima to the side and put an iron statue of Bhima in his place. That statue had been kept in the Kaurava camp, and Duryodhana had daily practiced on it with his mace. When Dhritarastra had seized the iron statue of Bhima, he squeezed it with all his strength and thus crushed it into dust. The King's chest was bruised, and he began to vomit blood.

Why did you allow him to make friendship with Duryodhana. You were negligent and not I. Why did you look indifferently on the gambling match and not speak up when the Pandavas were mistreated. By your silence, you encouraged the sinful activities of your son. You are responsible for the deaths of all these men. I endeavored to stop this war. I came to Hastinapura to make peace, but your vicious son would not listen. It was in your power to have him arrested and thrown in prison, but out of affection you did not follow My advice. You also knew about the burning of the house of lac before it happened. Your husband also knew, but both of you looked in another direction. This massacre of men is the fruit of your indifference toward your son's nefarious activities. Do not blame Me for all that has happened.

How can the Pandavas meet defeat when they are protected by the wielder of the Sarnga bow (Krishna)? O Suta, the divine feats of Vasudeva are unequaled by anyone on earth. While Krishna was being brought up in Nanda Maharaja's home, He made the might of His arms known to the world. He killed the rakshasi Putana while still a small child. In His infancy He also killed Kamsa's friend, Trinavarta, and slew the Keshi demon on the Yamuna bank. This horse was equal to the celestial steed Uchaishravas. In His childhood He also slew a great asura in the form of a bull. The divine son of Devaki has also killed Pralamba, Naraka, Jambha and Mura who were the terror of the heavenly gods. And also Kamsa, who was protected by Jarasandha, was slain by Krishna with His bare hands. Krishna then slew the Surasena King, Sunaman, who retained a full akshauhini division. Lord Krishna caused Jarasandha's death, who had elephant-like strength. He also hurled into the sea the demoniac city of Saubha which was owned by the great Shalva. He has defeated the Angas, the Vangas, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, the Kasis, the Koshalas, the Vatsyas, the Gargyas, the Karushas, and the Paundras. He, who has lotus petal eyes, has also defeated the Avantis, the Southerners, the Mountaineers, the Kambhojas, the Pandyas, the Trigartas, the Malavas, as well as the Yavanas. He has defeated the great Indra and Varuna in battle, and He has bewildered the creator of this universe, Lord Brahma. We have never heard of any king who was able to defeat Him. O Sanjaya, we personally experienced Krishna's universal form in our royal court before these hostilities began. O Suta, there can be no end to the infinite prowess of Hrishikesha. Will that Vasudeva, who the rishis describe as the Father of all, fight for the Pandavas? Will that Supreme Lord call upon His family members to assist Him? Will the heroic Samba, Pradyumna, Gada, Akrura, Carudeshna and Sarana take their weapons and fight with my sons? Will the Yadu host and Vrishni houses bring their wrath against my wicked son? Will Balarama, the carrier of the mace and plough, come to the Pandava's assistance? If this does happen, then my sons will be in greater danger. O Sanjaya, if Vasudeva puts on His armor, there will none amongst us who can withstand Him. Where there is Krishna, there will certainly be victory and fame. Krishna and Arjuna are none other than Narayana and Nara. O Suta, please tell me how the battle progressed, and how ultimately the great Drona fell from his chariot.

To, I will kill all these warriors like a forest fire consumes trees."" Approaching Arjuna, that multitude of warriors released thousands of arrows covering the chariot of Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna again blew on his conch, and released a weapon called Tvashtra. This weapon created the illusion of many thousands of Krishna's and Arjuna's. Confused by the illusion, the Samsaptakas began to kill each other thinking that they were Krishna and Arjuna. They pierced each other saying, ""There is Arjuna! This one is Krishna!"" Uttering such loud shouts, they killed each other. When the illusion disappeared, the remnants of the army rushed at Arjuna like moths entering fire. When their weapons filled the sky, Krishna questioned Arjuna, ""Because of this dense darkness, O Partha, I cannot see you. Are you alive, O slayer of the enemy?"" Not responding to Lord Krishna, Arjuna invoked the Vayavya astra that blew away those large numbers of weapons.

The answer is that the demigods are witnesses to our activities, and they testify to that in the court of Yamaraja after one leaves this body. If one dies following the rules of combat, one is elevated to the heavenly realm, and if one has cheated on the rules, he does not attain heaven, but is punished by Yamaraja, the justice of death. It is a shame that to's armies don't follow the rules of Vedic warfare.

The Kaurava warriors tried desperately to stop Abhimanyu, but within Drona's sight, Subhadra's son pierced that powerful formation and split it open. Endeavoring to close the open gap, large divisions of elephants, chariots and horsemen challenged Arjuna's son. They shouted loudly at him, ""Wait, Wait! Stand and fight!"" However, the aggressive Abhimanyu, coursing the battlefield, killed all those warriors who challenged him. With his mighty weapons, Arjuna's son cut off their heads, arms and legs as they approached him. Although the enemy rushed at him with great speed and were armed with every kind of weapon, their approach was like moths coming close to fire. Abhimanyu was severing the heads of the leading chariot fighters, and their empty chariots were running wild over the battlefield. Elephant divisions were slaughtered together and fell upon the infantry crushing their ranks. These huge beasts then formed a barrier between Abhimanyu and the enemy force, so great was the slaughter. Severed heads littered the ground, their eyes bulging from their sockets. Armless and headless trunks were lying here and there covered with blood and dust. There were countless fallen heroes who were covered with golden armor, garlands, sandalwood paste and fragrant oils. Many heroes lay with their tongues rolling out, and their eyes detached from their sockets, and others lay with their intestines and livers drawn out by Abhimanyu's arrows. Abhimanyu crushed the Kaurava ranks and caused them to flee from the battlefield.

Did you, out of hopelessness, cause that boy to enter that formation alone? Alas, has that heroic youth with lotus eyes pierced that great formation, and upon fighting with numerous warriors give up his life? What warrior deprived of his senses has slain my dearest son, that favorite of Draupadi and Keshava and dearly beloved of Kunti? What shall I say to Subhadra upon returning without her son? What shall I say unto Uttara, his dear wife, upon returning to the palace? Alas, it would be better for me to enter Yamaraja's abode than look upon the crying faces of those ladies.""

He fell into illusion much similar to the way Arjuna fell into illusion before the battle of Kurukshetra. One can be under the Yogamaya potency (divine potency of the Lord) or the Mahamaya potency (deluding potency of the Lord). The difference being that one under Mahamaya falls into deeper separation from the Lord when calamities appear, and one who has fallen under Yogamaya potency increase his attachment for the Lord when disaster happens. Through this whole episode we will see how the Pandavas increase their attachment for Lord Krishna. There was some temporary despondency at the death of Abhimanyu, but this only caused the Pandavas to increase their service attitude toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Pandavas were only instruments for the Lord's purpose of decreasing the burden of the earth. To fulfill the Lord's desire, Arjuna had to increase his anger toward the sinners. The unfair death of Abhimanyu was the catalyst to fulfill the Lord's desire.

Arjuna would pierce, with a single arrow, as many as two or three men riding on the same elephant, and they would fall to the ground hooked together by that arrow. Elephants were roaming the battlefield with armless and headless trunks hanging off their sides. Blood and flesh, flowing from the elephants and decapitated soldiers, created a ghastly scene that few could witness. Duhshasana was not able to ward of Arjuna's forceful weapons. Within a very short time thousands upon thousands of elephants littered the battlefield like huge barriers in a maze. Some of them had been pierced with one arrow and others with thousands. Some had their heads cut off, and others had their skulls spit open, gushing forth flesh and blood. Some of the huge beasts were completely cut in two and lay on the ground deprived of life. Some were only partially killed and lay on the ground shrieking in agony. Some of the elephants, upon falling to the ground, crushed foot soldiers and horsemen that were protecting them. The whole battlefield became a nightmare as Phalguna completely routed the huge division of elephants. Fleeing the battlefield, the remnants of that army sought Drona as its protector.

When the Rakshasa became invisible, Bhima filled the heavens with thousands of arrows greatly afflicting the powerful Rakshasa. Alambusha then entered the earth by his mystic power, and very soon, he was seen again in the sky assuming many hideous forms. He was  large and  small. He uttered frightful cries that echoed in all directions. He then caused thousands of arrows, darts, scimitars, lances, spiked maces and battle axes to fall from the sky upon the Pandava army. Hundreds of Pandava warriors were literally cut up into thousands of pieces by those weapons. Not tolerating the Rakshasa's victory, Bhima invoked the Tvashtri weapon that produced thousands of weapons destroying the Rakshasa's mystic illusions. Struck in every part of his body, Alambusha fled the battlefield.

While he was battling with the foremost Pandava warriors, he came upon the son of Bhima, Ghatotkacha. The son of Bhima pierced Alambusha with nine arrows and again with twenty. Those two mystic Rakshasas then began to throw up mystic illusions to slay the other in battle. Alambusha destroyed the mystic illusions of Ghatotkacha and produced his own to kill the son of Bhima. Seeing this, the other Pandavas came to the aid of Ghatotkacha and hemmed in the gigantic Rakshasa Alambusha. They covered him on all sides with thousands of arrows. Baffling that shower of arrows with his mystic illusions, he then freed himself from that encirclement of chariots. All of the Pandavas, Bhima, Yudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva as well as Ghatotkacha pierced the Rakshasa with hundreds of arrows. The Rakshasa Alambusha did not waver in the least and began to pierce those great warriors with his own arrows. He released countless arrows at Ghatotkacha piercing him deeply. Then the Pandavas, the sons of Draupadi and Ghatotkacha all rushed at Alambusha releasing their powerful weapons. Seeing them all coming with such great anger, Alambusha did not know what to do. Ghatotkacha came near the chariot of Alambusha and jumped upon it. He took the mystic Rakshasa by the hair and threw him from the chariot. Raising him up in the air and whirling him about, he dashed him to the ground with great force. With all his limbs smashed and blood flowing from the pours of his body, Alambusha gave up his life. The Pandava warriors sent up loud roars and blew their conches announcing Ghatotkacha's victory. With great enthusiasm, they again rushed against the Kaurava army killing them in thousands.

Those who died appreciating the wonderful deeds of Lord Krishna and Arjuna were elevated to the Vaikuntha planetary system in the spiritual world. Those who saw, at the last moment of their lives, Lord Krishna with a bridal whip in His right hand and the reins in His left, moving swiftly across the battlefield, never returned to this material world. Those who meditated on the beautiful lotus like face of Lord Krishna with His black curling hair and dazzling jeweled crown bedecked with a peacock feather, never returned again to inhabit a mortal fram. The Lord appeared to be working hard as He drove the chariot of His devotee. There were beads of sweat on His brow and blood flowed from the arrow wounds on His transcendental body.

The sound of the Gandiva bow exactly resembled the peal of thunder in a rain cloud, and Arjuna's arrows exactly resembled lightning bolts as they were released from the Gandiva bow. Arjuna then invoked the Aindra weapon, and from His bow came thousands upon thousands of arrows that were blazing with fire.

Many great warriors headed by Bhishma have fallen in this battle, but all of these are greater than the Pandavas. It is, therefore, destiny that is defeating us and not the Pandavas.

His horses can travel at the speed of mind and cannot be slain. Arjuna also possesses an inexhaustible quiver of arrows and the string on his bow is also celestial. The ape on Arjuna's banner is, indeed, wonderful. Although I am inferior to Arjuna in these respects, I will still fight with him. If it were possible for me to obtain a chariot driver that was equal to Krishna then I would certainly obtain victory. I think that Salya, the King of Madras, is equal to Krishna as a chariot driver. As Krishna is acquainted with horse lore, so also is Salya. Salya is superior to Krishna, and I am superior to Arjuna. I request that many carts filled with weapons be close to me, ready for use at my disposal. In this way I will become superior to Arjuna. If you can promise all that I have asked for, then I will give you victory.""

We should now go to the front line of the battle and fight with Dhritarastra's sons or the mighty Karna, whom you have vowed to slay.""

No one, who is conversant with truth, would act in this way. You desire to commit a deed that is condemned by the holy scriptures. Everything has to be seen through the eyes of scripture and great saintly persons. To kill one's older brother can never sanctioned by learned personalities. The killing of a person not engaged in battle, or one who has turned his face from battle, or one who seeks protection, or one who is carless, is never authorized by scripture. Why then do you wish to kill this revered superior? Morality is very difficult to understand. Listen to a story illustrating this point. Once there was an ascetic named Kausika, who did not have much scriptural knowledge. He lived a small distance from a village where several rivers met. He made a vow saying, 'I will always speak the truth.' He then became famous as one who never told a lie. One  some innocent persons, who were seeking refuge from some robbers, entered the forest near the sage's dwelling. Soon, the dacoits appeared there searching for these men to rob them. Approaching Kausika, they inquired, 'O holy one, by which path have those men gone who recently came here. Asking in the name of truth, reply to us.' When questioned in this way, Kausika said, 'Those men have entered the woods just near here.' The cruel thieves then slaughtered those innocent persons and took their wealth. For this sin, Kausika fell into hellish life and suffered greatly. There must be some process of distinguishing virtue from sin. Therefore, great sages have indicated that seeing through scriptural eye is the only distinct path to follow. However, the scriptures do not provide for every case. Hearing this from me, you should now decide whether your brother should be slain or not.""

When, however, he is disrespected, he is considered dead although still living in this body. The King has always been respected by all your brothers including yourself. If at this time of argument, you speak to him disrespectfully, it will be thought that he is dead although still alive. In the past you have addressed him as 'Your Majesty'. If you chastise him disrespectfully, he can thus be thought of as dead. This kind of death King Yudhisthira will never regard as offensive.

8|Karna Parva|Chapter Three|Lord Krishna Saves Yudhisthira from Death|True|"Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has made a point in this chapter that is instructive to all persons trying to make advancement in spiritual life. One must be able to see through the eye of scripture in order to understand certain situations in their proper light. Lord Krishna told Arjuna before the battle, tasmac chastram pramanam te, karyakarya-vyavasthitau, jnatva sastra-vidhanoktam, karma kartum iharhasi, ""One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may be gradually elevated."" ( B.g. 16.24) We must learn to see through the eye of the scripture. The holy books have been left for us by the previous acharyas to help see how to get out of this material world. Sufficient hearing of the these holy books, especially, Bhagavad-gita, Shrimad Bhagavatam and Chaitanya Charitamrita will provide the eyesight to find our way out of this material entanglement. One who rejects the holy scriptures and acts whimsically is putting himself in a very dangerous situation. Lord Krishna told Arjuna, yah sastra-vidham utsrjya, vartate kama-karatah, na sa siddhim avapnoti, na sukham na param gatim, ""But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination."" (B.g. 16.23) There is a three way check and balance in spiritual life: guru, sadhu and scripture. Of the three, scripture is the central point. The guru and sadhu must be able to quote scripture to support their points. If one doesn't support himself or his ideas using scriptural authority, he may cause a disturbance to people in general. This is confirmed by Rupa Goswami, sruti smrti-puranadi, pancaratra-vidhim vina, aikantiki harer bhaktir, utpatayaiva kalpate, ""Devotional service to the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanishads, Puranas, Narada-Pancharatra, etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society."" (Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu 1.2.101)

(S.B. 1.3.43) Shrimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental sound vibration which cleanses our dirty hearts, and help us to fix our minds at the lotus feet of Krishna. This is also confirmed in Shrimad-Bhagavatam, anarthopasamam saksad, bhakti-yogam adhoksaje, lokasyajanato vidvams, cakre satvata-samhitam, ""The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyasadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth."" (S.B. 1.7.6)

8|Karna Parva|Chapter Three|Lord Krishna Saves Yudhisthira from Death|True|"If we neglect or doubt the revealed scriptures, then our future is very dim. Lord Krishna told Arjuna, ajnas casraddadhanas ca, samsayatma vinasyati, nayam loko 'sti na paro, na sukham samsayatmanah, ""But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not attain God consciousness. For the doubting should there is happiness neither in this world nor in the next."" (B.g. 4.40) The conclusion is we must take the time to learn the holy books and see through their eyes. The spiritual master gives us these books to cure the cataract of material vision. om ajnana timaran dasya jnana jnana salakaya chaksur unmilitam yena tasmai shri guruve namah, In this verse the word salakaya means a medical instrument which applies medical ointment to the eye which is afflicted with cataract. Our spiritual eye is afflicted, and therefore the spiritual master applies the ointment of Vedic knowledge to open this eye by which we can see the kingdom of God. For this reason we offer our most humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

Following him were six bullock carts filled with his weapons. Duryodhana had sent Shakuni to challenge Bhima, but Shakuni could do nothing against Bhima's anger and was ultimately forced to retreat. Arjuna made his way toward Bhimasena and informed him that the King was resting after being mangled by Karna's arrows. Hearing of the King's welfare, Bhima became joyful, and descending from his chariot, he attacked the Kaurava army with mace in hand. He began to whirl his mace about his head causing mass destruction of the enemy soldiers. He soon killed ten thousand warriors and hundreds of elephants. His mace was covered in blood and flesh as he scorched the ranks of Duryodhana's army. He then ascended his chariot and proceeded behind Arjuna toward the place where Karna was engaged in combat.

Karna killed Satyaki's four horses, but Satyaki then killed the son of Karna, Prasena. Greatly enraged, Karna released an arrow to encompass Satyaki's death. As the arrow came blazing toward Satyaki, Shikhandi shattered it with his own weapons. Karna then killed the son of Dhristadyumna, even as Dhristadyumna looked on. As Karna was defeating the great Pandava generals one by one, he was also causing a great slaughter of the army. He pushed back the enemy ranks causing a massacre of men. Four thousand chariot fighters lay to his right and four thousand to his left. Hundreds of elephants were prostrated to the ground along with their riders by the arrows of Surya's son.

Now see if you can bear the force of my mace as I send you to the other world. To, I shall fulfill my vow and drink your blood on the field of battle!"" Duhshasana quickly threw a dart at Bhima, but the second son of Pandu released his club that shattered the dart and struck the son of Gandhari on the head. The mace was thrown with such speed that Duhshasana was knocked ninety feet from his chariot. Duhshasana lay on the ground rolling in pain. His armor, crown, hair and ornaments were displaced, and blood was flowing from his head. Bhima then remembered the offenses this person had committed in the past. He remembered how Duhshasana had grabbed the sanctified hair of his queen, Draupadi, and how he had uttered so many unkind words. His face became red hot, and he descended from his chariot. He then addressed Karna, Duryodhana, Kripa and Drona's son, ""To, I will kill this wretched Duhshasana. Let all of the warriors protect him if you can."" Bhima then rushed at Duhshasana and drew his razor sharp sword. He placed his foot on his neck and cut off the arm that had touched Draupadi's beautiful hair. He then opened Duhshasana's chest with his sword, and in the presence of all warriors, he drank the blood of that sinful person. He then severed Duhshasana's head and displayed it for all to see. With blood dripping from his mouth, he announced to the Kaurava warriors, ""The taste of this blood I regard as superior to the taste of milk, honey, butter and ghee."" Laughing with his mouth wide open, Bhima presented an appearance like Yamaraja himself. Some of the Kaurava warriors fell down in fear, and others dropped their weapons and stood feebly, overcome with disbelief. Some warriors fled away exclaiming, ""This one in no human being!""

8|Karna Parva|Chapter Four|The Death of Karna|False|"Hearing Karna's plea, Lord Krishna said, ""It is by good luck, O son of Radha, that you are now remembering virtue. It was yourself, Duhshasana, Duryodhana, and Shakuni who ordered Draupadi to be brought into the King's assembly with the idea of seeing her naked. Where was virtue then, O sinful person? When Yudhisthira was defeated unfairly at dice by the deceitful Shakuni, why didn't virtue enter your mind then? When Bhimasena was given a poisoned cake by the sinful Duryodhana, why didn't your virtue come out? When the Pandavas were exiled for thirteen years in the forest, where was your virtue? When Draupadi was dragged into the King's assembly, it was you who said, 'The Pandavas, O Draupadi, are lost. They have sunk into hell. Why don't you chose another husband?' You looked on that scene with delight. Where was your virtue at that time? When Abhimanyu was being unfairly defeated by six great warriors, where were your moral word? If at these times, virtue never came to your mouth, why then suddenly are you demanding righteousness? To, you shall not escape with your life, O sinful person. The Pandavas will defeat Duryodhana's army, and will win lasting fame. The Pandavas are protected by virtue.""

8|Karna Parva|Chapter Four|The Death of Karna|False|"Sanjaya continued: O King, thus addressed by the lotus eyed Vasudeva, Karna said nothing and hung his head in shame. With his lips quivering in rage, he took up his bow and continued to fight with Arjuna. He released a deadly weapon with the force of a thunderbolt and hit Partha in the chest, causing him to fall to the floor of the chariot. Karna then took the opportunity and tried to free his chariot. Although he struggled, he could not free the wheel from the ground. Then Lord Krishna said to Arjuna, ""Cut off your enemy's head before he ascends his chariot."" Agreeing with the words of the lotus eyed Lord, Arjuna quickly cut the standard from Karna's chariot. That banner which caused great inspiration the Kaurava army then fell to the ground signifying the death of the great hero. Arjuna then took from his quiver an Anjalika weapon that resembled Indra's thunderbolt. This arrow was six feet long and looked like a blazing rod of death. Upon setting the arrow to his bow, the earth began to tremble and the sky filled with wonderful sounds. Stretching his bow to full length, Arjuna released that arrow with the sound of a thunderbolt. Piercing through the sky, it severed the beautiful head of Surya's son. The mighty Anjalika weapon succeeded in slaying that foremost warrior of the earth. When Karna's head fell to the ground, a stream of blood shot out of Karna's trunk and with it came his life force. That spiritual spark then entered the sun planet to be united with his father.

Now that the Karna sun had set, the army was relieved of those burning rays. After Karna's death, his chariot was freed from the earth, and Salya drove it from the battlefield.

8|Karna Parva|Chapter Four|The Death of Karna|True|"In this chapter there is another point concerning morality. One may criticize Arjuna for killing Karna while he was pulling his chariot from the mud. However, if we remember from the Adi Parva, Karna was cursed by a brahmana to be killed while his chariot wheel was stuck in the earth. Arjuna was the instrument to fulfill that curse. According to the code of warfare, an enemy should not be killed when he is not properly armed, and Karna requested that Arjuna not kill him till his chariot was out of the earth. However, Lord Krishna reminded Karna of his lack of virtue and morality, and asked him why he was now requesting mercy, when he previously gave none. If Lord Krishna requested Arjuna not to show mercy to Karna, then that is the highest morality. Karna surely attained an exalted destination for seeing Lord Krishna and Arjuna at the last moment of his life. Lord Krishna informed Arjuna before the battle, anta-kale ca mam eva, smaran muktva kalevaram, yah prayati sa mad-bhavam, yati nasty atra samsayah, ""And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt."" (B.g. 8.5) Karna was fortunate to be killed while looking at Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Bhima certainly looked ghastly as he rose from Duhshasana's body, but that is the vow he took at the gambling match, since Duhshasana forcibly grabbed his wife, Draupadi, and tried to strip her naked.

9|Salya Parva|Chapter Two|The Fall of Duryodhana|True|Duryodhana has now eaten the bitter fruit of Vaishnava aparadha. Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has warned us about offending Vaishnavas. He instructed Rupa Goswami that there is a seed of devotional service which is planted in the heart, and it is watered by the process of hearing and chanting about Krishna. That seed sprouts into a creeper which must be protected. The greatest offense and annihilator of the devotional creeper is Vaishnava aparadha which is compared to a mad elephant. An elephant can destroy a small creeper very easily, and offending a Vaishnava is compared to letting an elephant loose in a small garden. The result is devastation. Duryodhana planted the seed of Vaishnava aparadha, and that seed grew into a creeper which eventually produced the bitter fruit of his death at the hands of Bhima.

Each opponent was able to pick the other up and throw him on the ground. There was fighting, pushing, shoving, and embracing; all executed with great expertise. Both looked equally qualified, and both were hopeful of victory. They kicked each other and dug their nails into each others body. Their heads collided like two boulders making a great sound. Those two broad-chested, long-armed heroes pulled and pressed, and whirled and hurled each other and struck each other with their knees, expressing their disgust for one another. They began to fight with bare arms which were like iron spiked maces. At last the invincible and mighty-armed Bhima, the slayer of his enemies, shouting aloud, seized Jimuta by his sturdy arms, and lifted him up. He began to whirl him round and round, to the great astonishment of the audience. And having whirled him around a hundred times till he was insensible, the stout-armed Vikrodara dashed him to his death on the ground. When the famed Jimuta was killed in this way, Virata and the Matsyas were very pleased and congratulated him. The King then caused him to fight with the other wrestlers and when all were defeated, he ordered Bhima to fight with lions and tigers, and also elephants.

4|Virata Parva|Chapter Two|Kichaka|True|"Here we see the reaction to adulterous activity. All the scriptures of the world say that one should not commit adultery. In the Islamic tradition if a man is not satisfied with one wife, he may take up to four. In the Christian tradition only one wife is allowed. In the s of Vedic culture, if a man was not satisfied with one wife, he could take as many wives as he could support. But in all bona fide scriptures adultery is forbidden, because the reaction to such activity is severe. One has to suffer in Yamaraja's abode after this life. Sex life is the binding force in this world, and only in the animal species can one have unlimited sex life. Those desiring unlimited sex are born in those species that facilitate such activity, like a rabbit, monkey or pigeon. Therefore, in the human form of life, sex is regulated with he idea that it will be eventually given up. As long as one is addicted to gross sex desire, he must be reborn in this world.

This is a time when the children are grown up, and the household couple are free to travel to different places of pilgrimage. They take a vow of celibacy. When the man reaches the age of 75, he should take sannyasa and completely devote his time to spiritual activities.

Nakula and Sahadeva accompanied him to defend his chariot wheels. Bhima rushed toward Susharma ordering, ""Stand your ground and fight! Do not run from the battlefield like a coward."" When challenged, King Susharman stood his ground, and taking up his bow, he faced the oncoming enemy protected by his powerful brothers. Thousands of chariots attacked Bhima; and thousands of chariots were destroyed by him within a twinkling of an eye. He soon again decimated thousands of elephants and thousands of foot soldiers within King Virata's sight. Looking on in horror, Susharman thought, ""Is my army going to be annihilated?"" Angered at the loss of so many soldiers, Susharman took up his bow, and drawing the string back to his ear began to release his forceful arrows.

Then, Bhima, the son of Kunti, killed Susharman's horses and dragged the wicked King from his chariot. King Susharma escaped from Bhima and quickly ran away. When Bhima saw that King Virata had come to his senses, he chased after Susharman mace in hand. Bhima called to him, ""Stand your ground! Do not flee!"" When challenged in these words, Susharman turned back and rushed at Bhima. Bhima immediately seized Susharman by the hair, and raising him up in the air, dashed him to the ground. As he lay their crying in agony, Bhima kicked him in the head. Pandu's second son then placed his knee on Susharman's chest and slapped his head around like a balloon. At this the Trigarta became senseless. Witnessing their King's defeat, the Trigarta army, stricken with fear, fled the battlefield. Bhimasena then took Susharman by the hair and drug him before King Virata inquiring, ""This wretched person does not deserve to live. What should I do with him?""

Arjuna has not come out of hiding unless the time period of exile has expired. The wheel of time revolves with it divisions. At certain times there are excesses which add up to two months every five years. Thus being the case, there would be an excess of five months in thirteen years. Arjuna has not come out of hiding unless he knew this fact. Therefore, O King, you can make the decision on whether to battle is proper. Arrange the forces quickly for Dhananjaya is at hand.""

Losing the use of his bow, he fled the battlefield. The next warrior to reach Arjuna was King Satruntapa. He was provoked and desired to put an end to Pandu's son.

Because he surrendered everything, the Lord Krishna empowered him to spread this movement and to lighten the earth's burden in the form of demoniac mentality. Shrila Prabhupada carried with him the empowerment of chanting the Hare Krishna maha mantra. He made this transcendental sound vibration a household word throughout the entire world.

4|Virata Parva|Chapter Five|The Pandavas Reveal Their Disguise|True|Yudhisthira was always humble, although achieving a high position in life. He respected all others, including the most insignificant citizen, and thus he was loved by all. Generally, Lord Krishna keeps his devotees in a poverty stricken condition so they can remain humble and make spiritual advancement. When the Lord sees that a devotee is completely free of material desire, He may bestow upon him uncommon material opulence as the Lord did with Yudhisthira, Sudama brahmana and our spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Shrila Prabhupada's life was dedicated to the order of his spiritual master to preach Krishna consciousness in the Western countries. He cared nothing for material opulence and came to America with only $7.00. He preached in poverty for one year, living in such lowly places as the bowery in New York City. When the Lord saw Shrila Prabhupada's unswerving determination, he bestowed upon him wealth, disciple and position. Shrila Prabhupada never misused these material assets nor became proud, but always remained a humble servant of his spiritual master. Without humility all our attempts at material or spiritual success will end up in disaster.|199|https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tilakd/mahabharata|259

Just see how the smoke encircles the sky. It appears that the earth and mountains are throbbing. Just hear the cloudless thunder and see the bolts from the blue. The wind blows violently, blasting dust everywhere and creating darkness. Clouds are raining everywhere with bloody disasters. The rays of the sun are declining, and the stars appear to be fighting amongst themselves. Confused living entities appear to be ablaze and weeping.

17|Mahaprasthanika Parva|NA|The Pandavas Return to the Spiritual World|False|"The birth, activities and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not like the activities of ordinary mortals in this world. As stated in the fourth chapter of Bhagavad-gita, ""One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."" One should not foolishly think the Mahabharata to be a fantasy made up by the imaginative minds of the great sages of old. The Mahabharata is pure fact. Vyasadeva, the literary incarnation of the Supreme Lord, wrote down the activities of the Lord and His devotees by virtue of His divine vision. Therefore, the Mahabharata and other Vedic literatures such as the Ramayana, Shrimad Bhagavatam, Upanishads and others are divinely inspired literatures and are meant to purify the mind and instill constant thought of the Supreme Lord. This is the final conclusion of this book. There are many editions of the Mahabharata which differ in small details, but the Siddhanta or conclusion is the most important ingredient. Whether Shishupala was killed with a Sudarshana discus or an arrow is not important. The important thing to understand is that Shishupala attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This summary study of the Mahabharata has taken the conclusions of the Shrimad Bhagavatam wherein many of the same pastimes are told. Originally the Mahabharata was written by Vyasadeva to attract the minds of the shudras, women and fallen twice born brahmanas. In it there are many descriptions of the heavenly planets and of fruitive activities. This summary study of the Mahabharata consists of the essence of spiritual life and concentrates on that theme. The essence is that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that we are all His servants. This Siddhanta has been stated in the eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavad-gita which is included in the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata. There Lord Krishna tells Arjuna, ""Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are my very dear friend. Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear."" Vyasadeva hoped that by reading the historical narrations of the Mahabharata common persons would be attracted to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita. We have tried to present Mahabharata so that this conclusion is present on every page. I hope that the readers of this edition will enjoy the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees the Pandavas, and remember the Supreme Lord Krishna by chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."|42|https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tilakd/mahabharata|660

I shall now declare the duties which belong to brahmanas exclusively. Sense control has been declared to be the first and foremost duty of a brahmana. Study of the Vedas and performance of austerities are also other duties of the brahminical order. Worship of the deity and teaching others how to worship the deity are duties of the brahminical order. Also there is accepting charity and giving in charity.

13|Anushasana Parva|NA|The Final Instructions of Grandfather Bhishma|False|"O Yudhisthira,  Bhishma continued, I shall now tell you the duties for the kshatriyas. A kshatriya should never beg, but should acquire wealth by taxing the citizens. He should study the Vedas, but not engage in the profession of teaching. He should offer protection to the citizens and put forward his prowess on the field of battle. There is no higher duty for a kshatriya than to protect the citizens. Gifts of charity, study of the Vedas and performance of sacrifice bring prosperity to a king. A king should engage all the subjects in their occupational duties according to their order of life. If a King does not perform any other act other than protect the citizens, he is regarded as successful in religious performance and has carried out all duties of a kshatriya.

13|Anushasana Parva|NA|The Final Instructions of Grandfather Bhishma|False|"O Bharata, a shudra should perform service to the other three orders according to seniority. By such service he will obtain happiness. He should never amass wealth for if he does he might make the higher orders his servants. Worn out umbrellas, turbans, beds, and seats, shoes and fans should be given to the shudra servants. Torn clothes which are no longer fit to wear should be given to the shudras as their clothing. Men conversant with morality say that if a shudra approaches one of the higher orders for service, then that servant should be immediately engaged in some duty. The weak and old amongst the shudra order should be maintained. A shudra should never give up his master no matter what condition of distress he falls into.

He also explained in divisions, acts of charity, the practical duties of a king and activities of salvation. Then he briefly described the duties of women and devotees, both briefly and extensively. Then he described the occupational duties of different orders and statuses of life, citing instances from history, for he was himself acquainted with the truth. While Bhishmadeva was describing occupational duties, the sun's course ran into the northern hemisphere. This period is described by mystics who die at their will.

13|Anushasana Parva|NA|The Final Instructions of Grandfather Bhishma|False|"Thereupon that man who spoke on different subjects with thousands of meanings and who fought on thousands of battlefields and protected thousands of men, stopped speaking and, being completely freed from all bondage, withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his wide-open eyes upon the original Personality of Godhead, Shri Krishna, who stood before him, four-handed, dressed in yellow garments that glittered and shined. By pure meditation, looking at Lord Shri Krishna, he at once was freed from all material inauspiciousness and was relieved of all bodily pains caused by the arrow wounds. Thus all the external activities of his senses at once stopped, and he prayed transcendentally to the controller of all living beings while quitting his material body. Grandfather Bhishma prayed, Let me invest my thinking, feeling, and willing, which were so long engaged in different subjects and occupational duties, in the all-powerful Lord Shri Krishna. He is always self-satisfied, but , being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending to the material world, although from Him only the material world is created. Lord Shri Krishna is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in His transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tamala tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus face, covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results. On the battlefield, the flowing hair of Lord Krishna turned ashen due to labor, and beads of sweat wetted His face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto Shri Krishna. In obedience to the command of His friend, Lord Shri Krishna entered the arena of the Battlefield of Kurukshetra between the soldiers of Arjuna and Duryodhana, and while there He shortened the life spans of the opposite party by His merciful glance. This was done simply by His looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that Lord Krishna.

May His lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction. Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up a wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way. May He, Lord Shri Krishna, the Personality of Godhead, who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination. On the battlefield He charged me, as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield was scattered, and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.

I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna's chariot by all means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original forms after death. Let my mind be fixed upon Lord Shri Krishna, whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of Vrajadhama. The damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the Lord.

This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord. Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord, Shri Krishna, now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone's heart.
